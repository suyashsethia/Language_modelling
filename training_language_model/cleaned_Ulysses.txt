and
she
never
left
us
a

all
for

her
soul
greatest
<UNK>
ever
was
actually
afraid

lay
out
4d
for
her

spirit
telling

all
her
<UNK>
she
had

<UNK>
and
the
end

let
us
have
a

first
god
help
the

if
all
the
women
were
her
sort
down
on
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
of
course
nobody
wanted
her
to
wear
them
i
suppose
she
was
pious
because
no
man
would
look
at
her
twice
i
hope
ill
never
be
like
her
a
wonder
she
didnt
want
us
to
cover
our
faces
but
she
was
a
<UNK>
woman
certainly
and
her
<UNK>
talk
about
mr
riordan
here
and
mr
riordan
there
i
suppose
he
was
glad
to
get
shut
of
her
and
her
dog
smelling
my
fur
and
always
<UNK>
to
get
up
under
my
petticoats
especially
then
still
i
like
that
in
him
polite
to
old
women
like
that
and
<UNK>
and
beggars
too
hes
not
proud
out
of
nothing
but
not
always
if
ever
he
got
anything
really
serious
the
matter
with
him
its
much
better
for
them
to
go
into
a
hospital
where
everything
is
clean
but
i
suppose
id
have
to
<UNK>
it
into
him
for
a
month
yes
and
then
wed
have
a
hospital
nurse
next
thing
on
the
carpet
have
him
staying
there
till
they
throw
him
out
or
a
nun
maybe
like
the
smutty
photo
he
has
shes
as
much
a
nun
as
im
not
yes
because
theyre
so
weak
and
<UNK>
when
theyre
sick
they
want
a
woman
to
get
well
if
his
nose
<UNK>
youd
think
it
was
o
<UNK>
and
that
<UNK>
one
off
the
south
circular
when
he
<UNK>
his
foot
at
the
choir
party
at
the
sugarloaf
mountain
the
day
i
wore
that
dress
miss
<UNK>
bringing
him
flowers
the
worst
old
ones
she
could
find
at
the
bottom
of
the
basket
anything
at
all
to
get
into
a
mans
bedroom
with
her
old
maids
voice
trying
to
imagine
he
was
dying
on
account
of
her
to
never
see
thy
face
again
though
he
looked
more
like
a
man
with
his
beard
a
bit
grown
in
the
bed
father
was
the
same
besides
i
hate
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
when
he
cut
his
toe
with
the
razor
<UNK>
his
corns
afraid
hed
get
<UNK>
but
if
it
was
a
thing
i
was
sick
then
wed
see
what
attention
only
of
course
the
woman
hides
it
not
to
give
all
the
trouble
they
do
yes
he
came
somewhere
im
sure
by
his
appetite
anyway
love
its
not
or
hed
be
off
his
feed
thinking
of
her
so
either
it
was
one
of
those
night
women
if
it
was
down
there
he
was
really
and
the
hotel
story
he
made
up
a
pack
of
lies
to
hide
it
<UNK>
it
hynes
kept
me
who
did
i
meet
ah
yes
i
met
do
you
remember
menton
and
who
else
who
let
me
see
that
big
<UNK>
i
saw
him
and
he
not
long
married
flirting
with
a
young
girl
at
<UNK>
<UNK>
and
turned
my
back
on
him
when
he
<UNK>
out
looking
quite
conscious
what
harm
but
he
had
the
impudence
to
make
up
to
me
one
time
well
done
to
him
mouth
almighty
and
his
boiled
eyes
of
all
the
big
<UNK>
i
ever
met
and
thats
called
a
solicitor
only
for
i
hate
having
a
long
wrangle
in
bed
or
else
if
its
not
that
its
some
little
bitch
or
other
he
got
in
with
somewhere
or
picked
up
on
the
sly
if
they
only
knew
him
as
well
as
i
do
yes
because
the
day
before
yesterday
he
was
scribbling
something
a
letter
when
i
came
into
the
front
room
to
show
him
dignams
death
in
the
paper
as
if
something
told
me
and
he
covered
it
up
with
the
blottingpaper
pretending
to
be
thinking
about
business
so
very
probably
that
was
it
to
somebody
who
thinks
she
has
a
<UNK>
in
him
because
all
men
get
a
bit
like
that
at
his
age
especially
getting
on
to
forty
he
is
now
so
as
to
<UNK>
any
money
she
can
out
of
him
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
and
then
the
usual
kissing
my
bottom
was
to
hide
it
not
that
i
care
two
<UNK>
now
who
he
does
it
with
or
knew
before
that
way
though
id
like
to
find
out
so
long
as
i
dont
have
the
two
of
them
under
my
nose
all
the
time
like
that
slut
that
mary
we
had
in
ontario
terrace
<UNK>
out
her
false
bottom
to
excite
him
bad
enough
to
get
the
smell
of
those
painted
women
off
him
once
or
twice
i
had
a
suspicion
by
getting
him
to
come
near
me
when
i
found
the
long
hair
on
his
coat
without
that
one
when
i
went
into
the
kitchen
pretending
he
was
drinking
water
<number>
woman
is
not
enough
for
them
it
was
all
his
fault
of
course
ruining
servants
then
<UNK>
that
she
could
eat
at
our
table
on
christmas
day
if
you
please
o
no
thank
you
not
in
my
house
<UNK>
my
potatoes
and
the
oysters
<number>
per
<UNK>
going
out
to
see
her
aunt
if
you
please
common
robbery
so
it
was
but
i
was
sure
he
had
something
on
with
that
one
it
takes
me
to
find
out
a
thing
like
that
he
said
you
have
no
proof
it
was
her
proof
o
yes
her
aunt
was
very
fond
of
oysters
but
i
told
her
what
i
thought
of
her
<UNK>
me
to
go
out
to
be
alone
with
her
i
wouldnt
lower
myself
to
spy
on
them
the
garters
i
found
in
her
room
the
friday
she
was
out
that
was
enough
for
me
a
little
bit
too
much
her
face
swelled
up
on
her
with
temper
when
i
gave
her
her
weeks
notice
i
saw
to
that
better
do
without
them
altogether
do
out
the
rooms
myself
quicker
only
for
the
damn
cooking
and
throwing
out
the
dirt
i
gave
it
to
him
anyhow
either
she
or
me
leaves
the
house
i
couldnt
even
touch
him
if
i
thought
he
was
with
a
dirty
barefaced
liar
and
<UNK>
like
that
one
<UNK>
it
up
to
my
face
and
singing
about
the
place
in
the
w
c
too
because
she
knew
she
was
too
well
off
yes
because
he
couldnt
possibly
do
without
it
that
long
so
he
must
do
it
somewhere
and
the
last
time
he
came
on
my
bottom
when
was
it
the
night
boylan
gave
my
hand
a
great
squeeze
going
along
by
the
<UNK>
in
my
hand
there
<UNK>
another
i
just
pressed
the
back
of
his
like
that
with
my
thumb
to
squeeze
back
singing
the
young
may
moon
shes
beaming
love
because
he
has
an
idea
about
him
and
me
hes
not
such
a
fool
he
said
im
<UNK>
out
and
going
to
the
gaiety
though
im
not
going
to
give
him
the
satisfaction
in
any
case
god
knows
hes
a
change
in
a
way
not
to
be
always
and
ever
wearing
the
same
old
hat
unless
i
paid
some
nicelooking
boy
to
do
it
since
i
cant
do
it
myself
a
young
boy
would
like
me
id
<UNK>
him
a
little
alone
with
him
if
we
were
id
let
him
see
my
garters
the
new
ones
and
make
him
turn
red
looking
at
him
<UNK>
him
i
know
what
boys
feel
with
that
down
on
their
cheek
doing
that
<UNK>
drawing
out
the
thing
by
the
hour
question
and
answer
would
you
do
this
that
and
the
other
with
the
<UNK>
yes
with
a
bishop
yes
i
would
because
i
told
him
about
some
dean
or
bishop
was
sitting
beside
me
in
the
jews
<UNK>
gardens
when
i
was
<UNK>
that
woollen
thing
a
stranger
to
dublin
what
place
was
it
and
so
on
about
the
monuments
and
he
tired
me
out
with
statues
encouraging
him
making
him
worse
than
he
is
who
is
in
your
mind
now
tell
me
who
are
you
thinking

who
is
it
tell
me
his
name
who
tell
me
who
the
german
<UNK>
is
it
yes
imagine
im
him
think
of
him
can
you
feel
him
trying
to
make
a
whore
of
me
what
he
never
will
he
ought
to
give
it
up
now
at
this
age
of
his
life
simply
<UNK>
for
any
woman
and
no
satisfaction
in
it
pretending
to
like
it
till
he
comes
and
then
finish
it
off
myself
anyway
and
it
makes
your
lips
pale
anyhow
its
done
now
once
and
for
all
with
all
the
talk
of
the
world
about
it
people
make
its
only
the
first
time
after
that
its
just
the
ordinary
do
it
and
think
no
more
about
it
why
cant
you
kiss
a
man
without
going
and
marrying
him
first
you
sometimes
love
to
wildly
when
you
feel
that
way
so
nice
all
over
you
you
cant
help
yourself
i
wish
some
man
or
other
would
take
me
sometime
when
hes
there
and
kiss
me
in
his
arms
theres
nothing
like
a
kiss
long
and
hot
down
to
your
soul
almost
<UNK>
you
then
i
hate
that
confession
when
i
used
to
go
to
father
corrigan
he
touched
me
father
and
what
harm
if
he
did
where
and
i
said
on
the
canal
bank
like
a
fool
but
whereabouts
on
your
person
my
child
on
the
leg
behind
high
up
was
it
yes
rather
high
up
was
it
where
you
sit
down
yes
o
lord
couldnt
he
say
bottom
right
out
and
have
done
with
it
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
and
did
you
whatever
way
he
put
it
i
forget
no
father
and
i
always
think
of
the
real
father
what
did
he
want
to
know
for
when
i
already
confessed
it
to
god
he
had
a
nice
fat
hand
the
palm
moist
always
i
wouldnt
mind
feeling
it
neither
would
he
id
say
by
the
<UNK>
in
his
<UNK>
i
wonder
did
he
know
me
in
the
box
i
could
see
his
face
he
couldnt
see
mine
of
course
hed
never
turn
or
let
on
still
his
eyes
were
red
when
his
father
died
theyre
lost
for
a
woman
of
course
must
be
terrible
when
a
man
cries
let
alone
them
id
like
to
be
<UNK>
by
one
in
his
<UNK>
and
the
smell
of
incense
off
him
like
the
pope
besides
theres
no
danger
with
a
priest
if
youre
married
hes
too
careful
about
himself
then
give
something
to
h
h
the
pope
for
a
penance
i
wonder
was
he
satisfied
with
me
one
thing
i
didnt
like
his
slapping
me
behind
going
away
so
<UNK>
in
the
hall
though
i
laughed
im
not
a
horse
or
an
ass
am
i
i
suppose
he
was
thinking
of
his
fathers
i
wonder
is
he
awake
thinking
of
me
or
dreaming
am
i
in
it
who
gave
him
that
flower
he
said
he
bought
he
smelt
of
some
kind
of
drink
not
whisky
or
stout
or
perhaps
the
sweety
kind
of
paste
they
stick
their
bills
up
with
some
<UNK>
id
like
to
sip
those
<UNK>
green
and
yellow
expensive
drinks
those
<UNK>
<UNK>
drink
with
the
opera
hats
i
tasted
once
with
my
finger
dipped
out
of
that
american
that
had
the
<UNK>
talking
stamps
with
father
he
had
all
he
could
do
to
keep
himself
from
falling
asleep
after
the
last
time
after
we
took
the
port
and
potted
meat
it
had
a
fine
salty
taste
yes
because
i
felt
lovely
and
tired
myself
and
fell
asleep
as
sound
as
a
top
the
moment
i
popped
straight
into
bed
till
that
thunder
woke
me
up
god
be
merciful
to
us
i
thought
the
heavens
were
coming
down
about
us
to
punish
us
when
i
blessed
myself
and
said
a
hail
mary
like
those
awful
<UNK>
in
gibraltar
as
if
the
world
was
coming
to
an
end
and
then
they
come
and
tell
you
theres
no
god
what
could
you
do
if
it
was
running
and
rushing
about
nothing
only
make
an
act
of
contrition
the
candle
i
lit
that
evening
in
<UNK>
street
chapel
for
the
month
of
may
see
it
brought
its
luck
though
hed
<UNK>
if
he
heard
because
he
never
goes
to
church
mass
or
meeting
he
says
your
soul
you
have
no
soul
inside
only
grey
matter
because
he
doesnt
know
what
it
is
to
have
one
yes
when
i
lit
the
lamp
because
he
must
have
come
<number>
or
<number>
times
with
that
<UNK>
big
red
brute
of
a
thing
he
has
i
thought
the
vein
or
whatever
the
<UNK>
they
call
it
was
going
to
burst
though
his
nose
is
not
so
big
after
i
took
off
all
my
things
with
the
blinds
down
after
my
hours
dressing
and
<UNK>
and
combing
it
like
iron
or
some
kind
of
a
thick
<UNK>
standing
all
the
time
he
must
have
eaten
oysters
i
think
a
few
dozen
he
was
in
great
singing
voice
no
i
never
in
all
my
life
felt
anyone
had
one
the
size
of
that
to
make
you
feel
full
up
he
must
have
eaten
a
whole
sheep
after
whats
the
idea
making
us
like
that
with
a
big
hole
in
the
middle
of
us
or
like
a
<UNK>
driving
it
up
into
you
because
thats
all
they
want
out
of
you
with
that
determined
<UNK>
look
in
his
eye
i
had
to
<UNK>
my
eyes
still
he
hasnt
such
a
<UNK>
amount
of
spunk
in
him
when
i
made
him
pull
out
and
do
it
on
me
considering
how
big
it
is
so
much
the
better
in
case
any
of
it
wasnt
washed
out
properly
the
last
time
i
let
him
finish
it
in
me
nice
invention
they
made
for
women
for
him
to
get
all
the
pleasure
but
if
someone
gave
them
a
touch
of
it
themselves
theyd
know
what
i
went
through
with
milly
nobody
would
believe
cutting
her
teeth
too
and
mina
<UNK>
husband
give
us
a
swing
out
of
your
whiskers
filling
her
up
with
a
child
or
twins
once
a
year
as
regular
as
the
clock
always
with
a
smell
of
children
off
her
the
one
they
called
<UNK>
or
something
like
a
nigger
with
a
shock
of
hair
on
it
<UNK>
the
child
is
a
black
the
last
time
i
was
there
a
squad
of
them
falling
over
one
another
and
bawling
you
couldnt
hear
your
ears
supposed
to
be
healthy
not
satisfied
till
they
have
us
swollen
out
like
<UNK>
or
i
dont
know
what
supposing
i
<UNK>
having
another
not
off
him
though
still
if
he
was
married
im
sure
hed
have
a
fine
strong
child
but
i
dont
know
poldy
has
more
spunk
in
him
yes
thatd
be
awfully
jolly
i
suppose
it
was
meeting
josie
powell
and
the
funeral
and
thinking
about
me
and
boylan
set
him
off
well
he
can
think
what
he
likes
now
if
thatll
do
him
any
good
i
know
they
were
<UNK>
a
bit
when
i
came
on
the
scene
he
was
dancing
and
sitting
out
with
her
the
night
of
georgina
simpsons
<UNK>
and
then
he
wanted
to
ram
it
down
my
neck
it
was
on
account
of
not
<UNK>
to
see
her
a
<UNK>
that
was
why
we
had
the
<UNK>
row
over
politics
he
began
it
not
me
when
he
said
about
our
lord
being
a
<UNK>
at
last
he
made
me
cry
of
course
a
woman
is
so
sensitive
about
everything
i
was
<UNK>
with
myself
after
for
giving
in
only
for
i
knew
he
was
gone
on
me
and
the
first
<UNK>
he
said
he
was
he
annoyed
me
so
much
i
couldnt
put
him
into
a
temper
still
he
knows
a
lot
of
<UNK>
things
especially
about
the
body
and
the
inside
i
often
wanted
to
study
up
that
myself
what
we
have
inside
us
in
that
family
physician
i
could
always
hear
his
voice
talking
when
the
room
was
crowded
and
watch
him
after
that
i
pretended
i
had
a
coolness
on
with
her
over
him
because
he
used
to
be
a
bit
on
the
jealous
side
whenever
he
asked
who
are
you
going
to
and
i
said
over
to
floey
and
he
made
me
the
present
of
<UNK>
<UNK>
and
the
three
pairs
of
gloves
so
that
finished
that
i
could
quite
easily
get
him
to
make
it
up
any
time
i
know
how
id
even
supposing
he
got
in
with
her
again
and
was
going
out
to
see
her
somewhere
id
know
if
he
refused
to
eat
the
onions
i
know
plenty
of
ways
ask
him
to
tuck
down
the
collar
of
my
blouse
or
touch
him
with
my
veil
and
gloves
on
going
out
<number>
kiss
then
would
send
them
all
spinning
however
<UNK>
well
see
then
let
him
go
to
her
she
of
course
would
only
be
too
delighted
to
pretend
shes
mad
in
love
with
him
that
i
wouldnt
so
much
mind
id
just
go
to
her
and
ask
her
do
you
love
him
and
look
her
square
in
the
eyes
she
couldnt
fool
me
but
he
might
imagine
he
was
and
make
a
<UNK>
to
her
with
his
<UNK>
kind
of
a
manner
like
he
did
to
me
though
i
had
the
devils
own
job
to
get
it
out
of
him
though
i
liked
him
for
that
it
showed
he
could
hold
in
and
wasnt
to
be
got
for
the
asking
he
was
on
the
pop
of
asking
me
too
the
night
in
the
kitchen
i
was
rolling
the
potato
cake
theres
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
only
for
i
put
him
off
letting
on
i
was
in
a
temper
with
my
hands
and
arms
full
of
<UNK>
flour
in
any
case
i
let
out
too
much
the
night
before
talking
of
dreams
so
i
didnt
want
to
let
him
know
more
than
was
good
for
him
she
used
to
be
always
embracing
me
josie
whenever
he
was
there
meaning
him
of
course
<UNK>
me
over
and
when
i
said
i
washed
up
and
down
as
far
as
possible
asking
me
and
did
you
wash
possible
the
women
are
always
<UNK>
on
to
that
putting
it
on
thick
when
hes
there
they
know
by
his
sly
eye
blinking
a
bit
putting
on
the
indifferent
when
they
come
out
with
something
the
kind
he
is
what
spoils
him
i
dont
wonder
in
the
least
because
he
was
very
handsome
at
that
time
trying
to
look
like
lord
byron
i
said
i
liked
though
he
was
too
beautiful
for
a
man
and
he
was
a
little
before
we
got
engaged
afterwards
though
she
didnt
like
it
so
much
the
day
i
was
in
fits
of
laughing
with
the
<UNK>
i
couldnt
stop
about
all
my
<UNK>
falling
out
one
after
another
with
the
mass
of
hair
i
had
youre
always
in
great
humour
she
said
yes
because
it
<UNK>
her
because
she
knew
what
it
meant
because
i
used
to
tell
her
a
good
bit
of
what
went
on
between
us
not
all
but
just
enough
to
make
her
mouth
water
but
that
wasnt
my
fault
she
didnt
<UNK>
the
door
much
after
we
were
married
i
wonder
what
shes
got
like
now
after
living
with
that
dotty
husband
of
hers
she
had
her
face
beginning
to
look
drawn
and
run
down
the
last
time
i
saw
her
she
must
have
been
just
after
a
row
with
him
because
i
saw
on
the
moment
she
was
<UNK>
to
draw
down
a
conversation
about
husbands
and
talk
about
him
to
run
him
down
what
was
it
she
told
me
o
yes
that
sometimes
he
used
to
go
to
bed
with
his
muddy
boots
on
when
the
maggot
takes
him
just
imagine
having
to
get
into
bed
with
a
thing
like
that
that
might
murder
you
any
moment
what
a
man
well
its
not
the
one
way
everyone
goes
mad
poldy
anyhow
whatever
he
does
always
<UNK>
his
feet
on
the
mat
when
he
comes
in
wet
or
shine
and
always
<UNK>
his
own
boots
too
and
he
always
takes
off
his
hat
when
he
comes
up
in
the
street
like
then
and
now
hes
going
about
in
his
slippers
to
look
for
<number>
for
a
postcard
u
p
up
o
sweetheart
may
wouldnt
a
thing
like
that
simply
bore
you
stiff
to
extinction
actually
too
stupid
even
to
take
his
boots
off
now
what
could
you
make
of
a
man
like
that
id
rather
die
<number>
times
over
than
marry
another
of
their
sex
of
course
hed
never
find
another
woman
like
me
to
put
up
with
him
the
way
i
do
know
me
come
sleep
with
me
yes
and
he
knows
that
too
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
take
that
mrs
<UNK>
that
poisoned
her
husband
for
what
i
wonder
in
love
with
some
other
man
yes
it
was
found
out
on
her
wasnt
she
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
to
go
and
do
a
thing
like
that
of
course
some
men
can
be
<UNK>
<UNK>
drive
you
mad
and
always
the
worst
word
in
the
world
what
do
they
ask
us
to
marry
them
for
if
were
so
bad
as
all
that
comes
to
yes
because
they
cant
get
on
without
us
white
arsenic
she
put
in
his
tea
off
<UNK>
wasnt
it
i
wonder
why
they
call
it
that
if
i
asked
him
hed
say
its
from
the
greek
leave
us
as
wise
as
we
were
before
she
must
have
been
<UNK>
in
love
with
the
other
fellow
to
run
the
chance
of
being
hanged
o
she
didnt
care
if
that
was
her
nature
what
could
she
do
besides
theyre
not
brutes
enough
to
go
and
hang
a
woman
surely
are
they
theyre
all
so
different
boylan
talking
about
the
shape
of
my
foot
he
noticed
at
once
even
before
he
was
introduced
when
i
was
in
the
d
b
c
with
poldy
laughing
and
trying
to
listen
i
was
<UNK>
my
foot
we
both
<UNK>
<number>
teas
and
plain
bread
and
butter
i
saw
him
looking
with
his
two
old
maids
of
sisters
when
i
stood
up
and
asked
the
girl
where
it
was
what
do
i
care
with
it
dropping
out
of
me
and
that
black
closed
breeches
he
made
me
buy
takes
you
half
an
hour
to
let
them
down
wetting
all
myself
always
with
some
brandnew
<UNK>
every
other
week
such
a
long
one
i
did
i
forgot
my
<UNK>
gloves
on
the
seat
behind
that
i
never
got
after
some
robber
of
a
woman
and
he
wanted
me
to
put
it
in
the
irish
times
lost
in
the
ladies
<UNK>
d
b
c
dame
street
<UNK>
return
to
mrs
marion
bloom
and
i
saw
his
eyes
on
my
feet
going
out
through
the
turning
door
he
was
looking
when
i
looked
back
and
i
went
there
for
tea
<number>
days
after
in
the
hope
but
he
wasnt
now
how
did
that
excite
him
because
i
was
crossing
them
when
we
were
in
the
other
room
first
he
meant
the
shoes
that
are
too
tight
to
walk
in
my
hand
is
nice
like
that
if
i
only
had
a
ring
with
the
stone
for
my
month
a
nice
<UNK>
ill
stick
him
for
one
and
a
gold
bracelet
i
dont
like
my
foot
so
much
still
i
made
him
spend
once
with
my
foot
the
night
after
goodwins
<UNK>
of
a
concert
so
cold
and
windy
it
was
well
we
had
that
rum
in
the
house
to
mull
and
the
fire
wasnt
black
out
when
he
asked
to
take
off
my
stockings
lying
on
the
<UNK>
in
lombard
street
west
and
another
time
it
was
my
muddy
boots
hed
like
me
to
walk
in
all
the
horses
dung
i
could
find
but
of
course
hes
not
natural
like
the
rest
of
the
world
that
i
what
did
he
say
i
could
give
<number>
points
in
<number>
to
<UNK>
<UNK>
and
beat
her
what
does
that
mean
i
asked
him
i
forget
what
he
said
because
the
<UNK>
edition
just
passed
and
the
man
with
the
curly
hair
in
the
<UNK>
dairy
thats
so
polite
i
think
i
saw
his
face
before
somewhere
i
noticed
him
when
i
was
<UNK>
the
butter
so
i
took
my
time
bartell
darcy
too
that
he
used
to
make
fun
of
when
he
<UNK>
kissing
me
on
the
choir
stairs
after
i
sang
<UNK>
ave
maria
what
are
we
waiting
for
o
my
heart
kiss
me
straight
on
the
brow
and
part
which
is
my
brown
part
he
was
pretty
hot
for
all
his
<UNK>
voice
too
my
low
notes
he
was
always
raving
about
if
you
can
believe
him
i
liked
the
way
he
used
his
mouth
singing
then
he
said
wasnt
it
terrible
to
do
that
there
in
a
place
like
that
i
dont
see
anything
so
terrible
about
it
ill
tell
him
about
that
some
day
not
now
and
surprise
him
ay
and
ill
take
him
there
and
show
him
the
very
place
too
we
did
it
so
now
there
you
are
like
it
or
lump
it
he
thinks
nothing
can
happen
without
him
knowing
he
hadnt
an
idea
about
my
mother
till
we
were
engaged
otherwise
hed
never
have
got
me
so
cheap
as
he
did
he
was
<number>
times
worse
himself
anyhow
begging
me
to
give
him
a
tiny
bit
cut
off
my
drawers
that
was
the
evening
coming
along
<UNK>
square
he
kissed
me
in
the
eye
of
my
glove
and
i
had
to
take
it
off
asking
me
questions
is
it
permitted
to
<UNK>
the
shape
of
my
bedroom
so
i
let
him
keep
it
as
if
i
forgot
it
to
think
of
me
when
i
saw
him
slip
it
into
his
pocket
of
course
hes
mad
on
the
subject
of
drawers
thats
plain
to
be
seen
always
<UNK>
at
those
<UNK>
things
on
the
<UNK>
with
their
skirts
blowing
up
to
their
<UNK>
even
when
milly
and
i
were
out
with
him
at
the
open
air
<UNK>
that
one
in
the
cream
muslin
standing
right
against
the
sun
so
he
could
see
every
<UNK>
she
had
on
when
he
saw
me
from
behind
following
in
the
rain
i
saw
him
before
he
saw
me
however
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
harolds
cross
road
with
a
new
<UNK>
on
him
with
the
muffler
in
the
<UNK>
colours
to
show
off
his
complexion
and
the
brown
hat
looking
<UNK>
as
usual
what
was
he
doing
there
where
hed
no
business
they
can
go
and
get
whatever
they
like
from
anything
at
all
with
a
skirt
on
it
and
were
not
to
ask
any
questions
but
they
want
to
know
where
were
you
where
are
you
going
i
could
feel
him
coming
along
<UNK>
after
me
his
eyes
on
my
neck
he
had
been
keeping
away
from
the
house
he
felt
it
was
getting
too
warm
for
him
so
i
<UNK>
and
stopped
then
he
<UNK>
me
to
say
yes
till
i
took
off
my
glove
slowly
watching
him
he
said
my
<UNK>
sleeves
were
too
cold
for
the
rain
anything
for
an
excuse
to
put
his
hand
anear
me
drawers
drawers
the
whole
blessed
time
till
i
promised
to
give
him
the
pair
off
my
doll
to
carry
about
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
o
maria
<UNK>
he
did
look
a
big
fool
<UNK>
in
the
rain
splendid
set
of
teeth
he
had
made
me
hungry
to
look
at
them
and
<UNK>
of
me
to
lift
the
orange
petticoat
i
had
on
with
the
<UNK>
pleats
that
there
was
nobody
he
said
hed
kneel
down
in
the
wet
if
i
didnt
so
<UNK>
he
would
too
and
ruin
his
new
<UNK>
you
never
know
what
<UNK>
theyd
take
alone
with
you
theyre
so
savage
for
it
if
anyone
was
passing
so
i
lifted
them
a
bit
and
touched
his
trousers
outside
the
way
i
used
to
gardner
after
with
my
ring
hand
to
keep
him
from
doing
worse
where
it
was
too
public
i
was
dying
to
find
out
was
he
circumcised
he
was
shaking
like
a
<UNK>
all
over
they
want
to
do
everything
too
quick
take
all
the
pleasure
out
of
it
and
father
waiting
all
the
time
for
his
dinner
he
told
me
to
say
i
left
my
purse
in
the
butchers
and
had
to
go
back
for
it
what
a
deceiver
then
he
wrote
me
that
letter
with
all
those
words
in
it
how
could
he
have
the
face
to
any
woman
after
his
company
manners
making
it
so
awkward
after
when
we
met
asking
me
have
i
offended
you
with
my
eyelids
down
of
course
he
saw
i
wasnt
he
had
a
few
brains
not
like
that
other
fool
<UNK>
doyle
he
was
always
breaking
or
tearing
something
in
the
charades
i
hate
an
<UNK>
man
and
if
i
knew
what
it
meant
of
course
i
had
to
say
no
for
form
sake
dont
understand
you
i
said
and
wasnt
it
natural
so
it
is
of
course
it
used
to
be
written
up
with
a
picture
of
a
womans
on
that
wall
in
gibraltar
with
that
word
i
couldnt
find
anywhere
only
for
children
seeing
it
too
young
then
writing
every
morning
a
letter
sometimes
twice
a
day
i
liked
the
way
he
made
love
then
he
knew
the
way
to
take
a
woman
when
he
sent
me
the
<number>
big
poppies
because
mine
was
the
<UNK>
then
i
wrote
the
night
he
kissed
my
heart
at
dolphins
barn
i
couldnt
describe
it
simply
it
makes
you
feel
like
nothing
on
earth
but
he
never
knew
how
to
embrace
well
like
gardner
i
hope
hell
come
on
monday
as
he
said
at
the
same
time
four
i
hate
people
who
come
at
all
hours
answer
the
door
you
think
its
the
vegetables
then
its
somebody
and
you
all
<UNK>
or
the
door
of
the
filthy
sloppy
kitchen
blows
open
the
day
old
<UNK>
goodwin
called
about
the
concert
in
lombard
street
and
i
just
after
dinner
all
flushed
and
tossed
with
boiling
old
stew
dont
look
at
me
professor
i
had
to
say
im
a
fright
yes
but
he
was
a
real
old
gent
in
his
way
it
was
impossible
to
be
more
<UNK>
nobody
to
say
youre
out
you
have
to
peep
out
through
the
blind
like
the
<UNK>
today
i
thought
it
was
a
<UNK>
first
him
sending
the
port
and
the
peaches
first
and
i
was
just
beginning
to
yawn
with
nerves
thinking
he
was
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
me
when
i
knew
his
<UNK>
at
the
door
he
must
have
been
a
bit
late
because
it
was
<number>
after
<number>
when
i
saw
the
<number>
dedalus
girls
coming
from
school
i
never
know
the
time
even
that
watch
he
gave
me
never
seems
to
go
properly
id
want
to
get
it
looked
after
when
i
threw
the
penny
to
that
lame
sailor
for
england
home
and
beauty
when
i
was
whistling
there
is
a
charming
girl
i
love
and
i
hadnt
even
put
on
my
clean
shift
or
powdered
myself
or
a
thing
then
this
day
week
were
to
go
to
belfast
just
as
well
he
has
to
go
to
ennis
his
fathers
anniversary
the
<UNK>
it
wouldnt
be
pleasant
if
he
did
suppose
our
rooms
at
the
hotel
were
beside
each
other
and
any
fooling
went
on
in
the
new
bed
i
couldnt
tell
him
to
stop
and
not
bother
me
with
him
in
the
next
room
or
perhaps
some
protestant
clergyman
with
a
cough
knocking
on
the
wall
then
hed
never
believe
the
next
day
we
didnt
do
something
its
all
very
well
a
husband
but
you
cant
fool
a
lover
after
me
telling
him
we
never
did
anything
of
course
he
didnt
believe
me
no
its
better
hes
going
where
he
is
besides
something
always
happens
with
him
the
time
going
to
the
<UNK>
concert
at
<UNK>
<UNK>
boiling
soup
for
the
two
of
us
then
the
bell
rang
out
he
walks
down
the
platform
with
the
soup
splashing
about
taking
<UNK>
of
it
hadnt
he
the
nerve
and
the
waiter
after
him
making
a
holy
show
of
us
<UNK>
and
confusion
for
the
engine
to
start
but
he
wouldnt
pay
till
he
finished
it
the
two
gentlemen
in
the
<UNK>
class
carriage
said
he
was
quite
right
so
he
was
too
hes
so
<UNK>
sometimes
when
he
gets
a
thing
into
his
head
a
good
job
he
was
able
to
open
the
carriage
door
with
his
knife
or
theyd
have
taken
us
on
to
cork
i
suppose
that
was
done
out
of
revenge
on
him
o
i
love
jaunting
in
a
train
or
a
car
with
lovely
soft
cushions
i
wonder
will
he
take
a
1st
class
for
me
he
might
want
to
do
it
in
the
train
by
tipping
the
guard
well
o
i
suppose
<UNK>
be
the
usual
<UNK>
of
men
gaping
at
us
with
their
eyes
as
stupid
as
ever
they
can
possibly
be
that
was
an
<UNK>
man
that
common
<UNK>
that
left
us
alone
in
the
carriage
that
day
going
to
howth
id
like
to
find
out
something
about
him
<number>
or
<number>
<UNK>
perhaps
then
you
have
to
look
out
of
the
window
all
the
nicer
then
coming
back
suppose
i
never
came
back
what
would
they
say
<UNK>
with
him
that
gets
you
on
on
the
stage
the
last
concert
i
sang
at
where
its
over
a
year
ago
when
was
it
st
<UNK>
hall
<UNK>
st
little
<UNK>
of
<UNK>
they
have
now
singing
kathleen
kearney
and
her
like
on
account
of
father
being
in
the
army
and
my
singing
the
absentminded
beggar
and
wearing
a
brooch
for
lord
roberts
when
i
had
the
map
of
it
all
and
poldy
not
irish
enough
was
it
him
managed
it
this
time
i
wouldnt
put
it
past
him
like
he
got
me
on
to
sing
in
the
stabat
mater
by
going
around
saying
he
was
putting
lead
kindly
light
to
music
i
put
him
up
to
that
till
the
<UNK>
found
out
he
was
a
<UNK>
thumping
the
piano
lead
thou
me
on
copied
from
some
old
opera
yes
and
he
was
going
about
with
some
of
them
sinner
fein
lately
or
whatever
they
call
themselves
talking
his
usual
<UNK>
and
nonsense
he
says
that
little
man
he
showed
me
without
the
neck
is
very
intelligent
the
coming
man
<UNK>
is
he
well
he
doesnt
look
it
thats
all
i
can
say
still
it
must
have
been
him
he
knew
there
was
a
<UNK>
i
hate
the
mention
of
their
politics
after
the
war
that
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
where
gardner
<UNK>
<UNK>
g
<UNK>
<UNK>
2nd
east
<UNK>
<UNK>
of
<UNK>
fever
he
was
a
lovely
fellow
in
<UNK>
and
just
the
right
height
over
me
im
sure
he
was
brave
too
he
said
i
was
lovely
the
evening
we
kissed
goodbye
at
the
canal
lock
my
irish
beauty
he
was
pale
with
excitement
about
going
away
or
wed
be
seen
from
the
road
he
couldnt
stand
properly
and
i
so
hot
as
i
never
felt
they
could
have
made
their
peace
in
the
beginning
or
old
<UNK>
paul
and
the
rest
of
the
other
old
<UNK>
go
and
fight
it
out
between
them
instead
of
dragging
on
for
years
killing
any
<UNK>
men
there
were
with
their
fever
if
he
was
even
<UNK>
shot
it
wouldnt
have
been
so
bad
i
love
to
see
a
regiment
pass
in
<UNK>
the
first
time
i
saw
the
spanish
cavalry
at
la
<UNK>
it
was
lovely
after
looking
across
the
bay
from
<UNK>
all
the
lights
of
the
rock
like
<UNK>
or
those
sham
battles
on
the
<number>
acres
the
black
watch
with
their
<UNK>
in
time
at
the
march
past
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
the
prince
of
wales
own
or
the
<UNK>
o
the
<UNK>
theyre
grand
or
the
dublins
that
won
<UNK>
his
father
made
his
money
over
selling
the
horses
for
the
cavalry
well
he
could
buy
me
a
nice
present
up
in
belfast
after
what
i
gave
him
theyve
lovely
linen
up
there
or
one
of
those
nice
kimono
things
i
must
buy
a
<UNK>
like
i
had
before
to
keep
in
the
drawer
with
them
it
would
be
<UNK>
going
round
with
him
<UNK>
buying
those
things
in
a
new
city
better
leave
this
ring
behind
want
to
keep
turning
and
turning
to
get
it
over
the
knuckle
there
or
they
might
bell
it
round
the
town
in
their
papers
or
tell
the
police
on
me
but
theyd
think
were
married
o
let
them
all
go
and
<UNK>
themselves
for
the
fat
lot
i
care
he
has
plenty
of
money
and
hes
not
a
marrying
man
so
somebody
better
get
it
out
of
him
if
i
could
find
out
whether
he
likes
me
i
looked
a
bit
<UNK>
of
course
when
i
looked
close
in
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
a
mirror
never
gives
you
the
expression
besides
<UNK>
down
on
me
like
that
all
the
time
with
his
big
<UNK>
hes
heavy
too
with
his
hairy
chest
for
this
heat
always
having
to
lie
down
for
them
better
for
him
put
it
into
me
from
behind
the
way
mrs
mastiansky
told
me
her
husband
made
her
like
the
dogs
do
it
and
stick
out
her
tongue
as
far
as
ever
she
could
and
he
so
quiet
and
mild
with
his
<UNK>
<UNK>
can
you
ever
be
up
to
men
the
way
it
takes
them
lovely
stuff
in
that
blue
suit
he
had
on
and
stylish
tie
and
socks
with
the
skyblue
silk
things
on
them
hes
certainly
<UNK>
i
know
by
the
cut
his
clothes
have
and
his
heavy
watch
but
he
was
like
a
perfect
devil
for
a
few
minutes
after
he
came
back
with
the
<UNK>
tearing
up
the
tickets
and
swearing
blazes
because
he
lost
<number>
quid
he
said
he
lost
over
that
outsider
that
won
and
half
he
put
on
for
me
on
account
of
lenehans
tip
cursing
him
to
the
lowest
<UNK>
that
<UNK>
he
was
making
free
with
me
after
the
glencree
dinner
coming
back
that
long
<UNK>
over
the
featherbed
mountain
after
the
lord
mayor
looking
at
me
with
his
dirty
eyes
val
dillon
that
big
heathen
i
first
noticed
him
at
<UNK>
when
i
was
cracking
the
nuts
with
my
teeth
i
wished
i
could
have
picked
every
morsel
of
that
chicken
out
of
my
fingers
it
was
so
tasty
and
<UNK>
and
as
tender
as
anything
only
for
i
didnt
want
to
eat
everything
on
my
plate
those
forks
and
<UNK>
were
<UNK>
silver
too
i
wish
i
had
some
i
could
easily
have
slipped
a
couple
into
my
muff
when
i
was
playing
with
them
then
always
hanging
out
of
them
for
money
in
a
restaurant
for
the
bit
you
put
down
your
throat
we
have
to
be
<UNK>
for
our
mangy
cup
of
tea
itself
as
a
great
compliment
to
be
noticed
the
way
the
world
is
divided
in
any
case
if
its
going
to
go
on
i
want
at
least
two
other
good
<UNK>
for
one
thing
and
but
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
drawers
he
likes
none
at
all
i
think
didnt
he
say
yes
and
half
the
girls
in
gibraltar
never
wore
them
either
naked
as
god
made
them
that
<UNK>
singing
her
<UNK>
she
didnt
make
much
secret
of
what
she
hadnt
yes
and
the
second
pair
of
<UNK>
stockings
is
<UNK>
after
one
days
wear
i
could
have
brought
them
back
to
<UNK>
this
morning
and
kicked
up
a
row
and
made
that
one
change
them
only
not
to
upset
myself
and
run
the
risk
of
walking
into
him
and
ruining
the
whole
thing
and
one
of
those
<UNK>
corsets
id
want
<UNK>
cheap
in
the
gentlewoman
with
elastic
<UNK>
on
the
hips
he
saved
the
one
i
have
but
thats
no
good
what
did
they
say
they
give
a
delightful
figure
line
<number>
obviating
that
<UNK>
broad
appearance
across
the
lower
back
to
<UNK>
flesh
my
belly
is
a
bit
too
big
ill
have
to
knock
off
the
stout
at
dinner
or
am
i
getting
too
fond
of
it
the
last
they
sent
from
orourkes
was
as
flat
as
a
<UNK>
he
makes
his
money
easy
larry
they
call
him
the
old
mangy
parcel
he
sent
at
<UNK>
a
cottage
cake
and
a
bottle
of
<UNK>
he
tried
to
palm
off
as
claret
that
he
couldnt
get
anyone
to
drink
god
spare
his
spit
for
fear
hed
die
of
the
drouth
or
i
must
do
a
few
breathing
exercises
i
wonder
is
that
<UNK>
any
good
might
<UNK>
it
the
thin
ones
are
not
so
much
the
fashion
now
garters
that
much
i
have
the
violet
pair
i
wore
today
thats
all
he
bought
me
out
of
the
cheque
he
got
on
the
first
o
no
there
was
the
face
lotion
i
finished
the
last
of
yesterday
that
made
my
skin
like
new
i
told
him
over
and
over
again
get
that
made
up
in
the
same
place
and
dont
forget
it
god
only
knows
whether
he
did
after
all
i
said
to
him
ill
know
by
the
bottle
anyway
if
not
i
suppose
ill
only
have
to
wash
in
my
piss
like
<UNK>
or
<UNK>
with
some
of
that
opoponax
and
violet
i
thought
it
was
beginning
to
look
coarse
or
old
a
bit
the
skin
underneath
is
much
<UNK>
where
it
peeled
off
there
on
my
finger
after
the
burn
its
a
pity
it
isnt
all
like
that
and
the
four
paltry
handkerchiefs
about
<number>
in
all
sure
you
cant
get
on
in
this
world
without
style
all
going
in
food
and
rent
when
i
get
it
ill
<UNK>
it
around
i
tell
you
in
fine
style
i
always
want
to
throw
a
handful
of
tea
into
the

a
lovely
woman
magnificent
head

her
waist
tossing

back
like
that
like
kitty
<UNK>
in
<UNK>

i
did
every

to
look
across
see
her
combing
it
as
if
she
loved
it
and
was
full
of
it
pity
i
only
got
to
know
her
the
day
before
we
left
and
that
mrs
<UNK>
the
jersey
lily
the
prince
of
wales
was
in
love
with
i
suppose
hes
like
the
first
man
going
the
roads
only
for
the
name
of
a
king
theyre
all
made
the
one
way
only
a
black
mans
id
like
to
try
a
beauty
up
to
what
was
she
<number>
there
was
some
funny
story
about
the
jealous
old
husband
what
was
it
at
all
and
an
oyster
knife
he
went
no
he
made
her
wear
a
kind
of
a
tin
thing
round
her
and
the
prince
of
wales
yes
he
had
the
oyster
knife
cant
be
true
a
thing
like
that
like
some
of
those
books
he
brings
me
the
works
of
master
<UNK>
somebody
supposed
to
be
a
priest
about
a
child
born
out
of
her
ear
because
her
<UNK>
fell
out
a
nice
word
for
any
priest
to
write
and
her
<UNK>
as
if
any
fool
wouldnt
know
what
that
meant
i
hate
that
pretending
of
all
things
with
that
old
<UNK>
face
on
him
anybody
can
see
its
not
true
and
that
ruby
and
fair
tyrants
he
brought
me
that
twice
i
remember
when
i
came
to
page
<number>
the
part
about
where
she
hangs
him
up
out
of
a
hook
with
a
cord
<UNK>
sure
theres
nothing
for
a
woman
in
that
all
invention
made
up
about
he
drinking
the
champagne
out
of
her
slipper
after
the
ball
was
over
like
the
infant
jesus
in
the
<UNK>
at
inchicore
in
the
blessed
virgins
arms
sure
no
woman
could
have
a
child
that
big
taken
out
of
her
and
i
thought
first
it
came
out
of
her
side
because
how
could
she
go
to
the
chamber
when
she
wanted
to
and
she
a
rich
lady
of
course
she
felt
honoured
h
r
h
he
was
in
gibraltar
the
year
i
was
born
i
bet
he
found
<UNK>
there
too
where
he
planted
the
tree
he
planted
more
than
that
in
his
time
he
might
have
planted
me
too
if
hed
come
a
bit
sooner
then
i
wouldnt
be
here
as
i
am
he
ought
to
chuck
that
freeman
with
the
paltry
few
shillings
he
<UNK>
out
of
it
and
go
into
an
office
or
something
where
hed
get
regular
pay
or
a
bank
where
they
could
put
him
up
on
a
throne
to
count
the
money
all
the
day
of
course
he
<UNK>
<UNK>
about
the
house
so
you
cant
stir
with
him
any
side
whats
your
programme
today
i
wish
hed
even
smoke
a
pipe
like
father
to
get
the
smell
of
a
man
or
pretending
to
be
<UNK>
about
for
<UNK>
when
he
could
have
been
in
mr
cuffes
still
only
for
what
he
did
then
sending
me
to
try
and
patch
it
up
i
could
have
got
him
<UNK>
there
to
be
the
manager
he
gave
me
a
great
<UNK>
once
or
twice
first
he
was
as
stiff
as
the
mischief
really
and
truly
mrs
bloom
only
i
felt
rotten
simply
with
the
old
<UNK>
dress
that
i
lost
the
leads
out
of
the
tails
with
no
cut
in
it
but
theyre
coming
into
fashion
again
i
bought
it
simply
to
please
him
i
knew
it
was
no
good
by
the
finish
pity
i
changed
my
mind
of
going
to
<UNK>
and
burns
as
i
said
and
not
<UNK>
it
was
just
like
the
shop
itself
<UNK>
sale
a
lot
of
<UNK>
i
hate
those
rich
<UNK>
get
on
your
nerves
nothing
kills
me
altogether
only
he
thinks
he
knows
a
great
lot
about
a
womans
dress
and
cooking
<UNK>
everything
he
can
<UNK>
off
the
shelves
into
it
if
i
went
by
his
<UNK>
every
blessed
hat
i
put
on
does
that
suit
me
yes
take
that
thats
<UNK>
the
one
like
a
<UNK>
standing
up
miles
off
my
head
he
said
suited
me
or
the
<UNK>
one
coming
down
on
my
backside
on
pins
and
needles
about
the
<UNK>
in
that
place
in
grafton
street
i
had
the
<UNK>
to
bring
him
into
and
she
as
insolent
as
ever
she
could
be
with
her
<UNK>
saying
im
afraid
were
giving
you
too
much
trouble
what
shes
there
for
but
i
stared
it
out
of
her
yes
he
was
awfully
stiff
and
no
wonder
but
he
changed
the
second
time
he
looked
poldy
<UNK>
as
usual
like
the
soup
but
i
could
see
him
looking
very
hard
at
my
chest
when
he
stood
up
to
open
the
door
for
me
it
was
nice
of
him
to
show
me
out
in
any
case
im
extremely
sorry
mrs
bloom
believe
me
without
making
it
too
marked
the
first
time
after
him
being
insulted
and
me
being
supposed
to
be
his
wife
i
just
half
smiled
i
know
my
chest
was
out
that
way
at
the
door
when
he
said
im
extremely
sorry
and
im
sure
you
were
yes
i
think
he
made
them
a
bit
firmer
sucking
them
like
that
so
long
he
made
me
thirsty
<UNK>
he
calls
them
i
had
to
laugh
yes
this
one
anyhow
stiff
the
nipple
gets
for
the
least
thing
ill
get
him
to
keep
that
up
and
ill
take
those
eggs
<UNK>
up
with
<UNK>
<UNK>
them
out
for
him
what
are
all
those
veins
and
things
curious
the
way
its
made
<number>
the
same
in
case
of
twins
theyre
supposed
to
represent
beauty
placed
up
there
like
those
statues
in
the
museum
one
of
them
pretending
to
hide
it
with
her
hand
are
they
so
beautiful
of
course
compared
with
what
a
man
looks
like
with
his
two
bags
full
and
his
other
thing
hanging
down
out
of
him
or
sticking
up
at
you
like
a
<UNK>
no
wonder
they
hide
it
with
a
<UNK>
that
<UNK>
cameron
<UNK>
behind
the
meat
market
or
that
other
wretch
with
the
red
head
behind
the
tree
where
the
statue
of
the
fish
used
to
be
when
i
was
passing
pretending
he
was
<UNK>
standing
out
for
me
to
see
it
with
his
<UNK>
up
to
one
side
the
queens
own
they
were
a
nice
lot
its
well
the
<UNK>
relieved
them
theyre
always
trying
to
show
it
to
you
every
time
nearly
i
passed
outside
the
mens
<UNK>
near
the
<UNK>
street
station
just
to
try
some
fellow
or
other
trying
to
catch
my
eye
as
if
it
was
<number>
of
the
<number>
wonders
of
the
world
o
and
the
stink
of
those
rotten
places
the
night
coming
home
with
poldy
after
the
<UNK>
party
oranges
and
lemonade
to
make
you
feel
nice
and
watery
i
went
into
<number>
of
them
it
was
so
biting
cold
i
couldnt
keep
it
when
was
that
<number>
the
canal
was
frozen
yes
it
was
a
few
months
after
a
pity
a
couple
of
the
<UNK>
werent
there
to
see
me
<UNK>
in
the
mens
place
<UNK>
i
tried
to
draw
a
picture
of
it
before
i
tore
it
up
like
a
sausage
or
something
i
wonder
theyre
not
afraid
going
about
of
getting
a
kick
or
a
bang
of
something
there
the
woman
is
beauty
of
course
thats
admitted
when
he
said
i
could
pose
for
a
picture
naked
to
some
rich
fellow
in
holles
street
when
he
lost
the
job
in
helys
and
i
was
selling
the
clothes
and
<UNK>
in
the
coffee
palace
would
i
be
like
that
bath
of
the
nymph
with
my
hair
down
yes

shes
younger
or
im
a
little
like
that
dirty
bitch
in
that
spanish
photo
he
has
nymphs
used
they
go
about
like
that
i
asked
him
about
her
and
that
word
met
something
with
hoses
in
it
and
he
came
out
with
some
<UNK>
about
the
<UNK>
he
never
can
explain
a
thing
simply
the
way
a
body
can
understand
then
he
goes
and
burns
the
bottom
out
of
the
pan
all
for
his
kidney
this
one
not
so
much
theres
the
mark
of
his
teeth
still
where
he
tried
to
bite
the
nipple
i
had
to
scream
out
arent
they
<UNK>
trying
to
hurt
you
i
had
a
great
breast
of
milk
with
milly
enough
for
two
what
was
the
reason
of
that
he
said
i
could
have
got
a
pound
a
week
as
a
wet
nurse
all
swelled
out
the
morning
that
delicate
looking
student
that
stopped
in
no
<number>
with
the
citrons
penrose
nearly
caught
me
washing
through
the
window
only
for
i
snapped
up
the
towel
to
my
face
that
was
his
<UNK>
hurt
me
they
used
to
<UNK>
her
till

the
<UNK>
<UNK>
i

to
get
him
to
suck
them

<UNK>
and
<UNK>
than
cows
then
he
wanted
to
milk
me
into
the
tea
well
hes
beyond
everything
i
declare
somebody
ought
to
put
him
in
the
budget
if
i
only
could
remember
the
one
half
of
the
things
and
write
a
book
out
of
it
the
works
of
master
poldy
yes
and
its
so
much
<UNK>
the
skin
much
an
hour

was
at
them
im
sure
by
the
clock
like
some
kind
of
a
big
infant
i
had
at
me
they
want
everything
in
their
mouth
all
the
pleasure
those
men
get
out
of
a
woman
i
can
feel
his
mouth
o
lord
i
must
stretch
myself
i
wished
he
was
here
or
somebody
to
let
myself
go
with
and
come
again
like
that
i
feel
all
fire
inside
me
or
if
i
could
dream
it
when
he
made
me

the
2nd
time
tickling
me
behind
with
his
finger
i
was
coming
for
about
<number>
minutes
with
my
legs

look
with

his
foot
for

when

to
charge
the
<UNK>
with
the
<UNK>
and
the
<number>
things
in
their

his
heart
at
me
taking

barking
in
bell
lane
poor
brute
and
it
sick
what

like
all
through
a
mist

you
feel
so
old
i
made
the
scones

used
to
compare
our
hair

than
hers
she
showed
me
how
to
settle
it
at
the
back
when
i
put
it
up
and
whats
this
else
how
to
make
a
knot
on
a
thread
with
the
one

like
cousins
what
age

i
then
the
night
of
the

had
her
arms
round
me

fighting
in
the
morning
with
the
pillow
what
fun
he
was
watching
me
whenever
he
got
an
opportunity
at
the
band
on
the
alameda
<UNK>
when
i
was
with
father
and
captain
grove
i
looked
up
at
the
church
first
and
then
at
the
windows
then
down
and
our
eyes
met
i
felt
something
go
through
me
like
all
needles
my
eyes
were
dancing
i
remember
after
when
i
looked
at
myself
in
the
glass
hardly
recognised
myself
the
change
he
was
attractive
to
a
girl
in
spite
of
his
being
a
little
bald
intelligent
looking
disappointed
and
gay
at
the
same
time
he
was
like
thomas
in
the
shadow
of
<UNK>
i
had
a
splendid
skin
from
the
sun
and
the
excitement
like
a
rose
i
didnt
get
a
wink
of
sleep
it
wouldnt
have
been
nice
on
account
of
her
but
i
could
have
stopped
it
in
time
she
gave
me
the
<UNK>
to
read
that
was
the
first
i
read
of
<UNK>

be
weltering
then
in
the
heat
my
shift
drenched
with
the
sweat
stuck
in
the
cheeks
of
my
bottom
on
the
chair
when
i
stood
up
they
were
so
<UNK>
and
firm
when
i
got
up
on
the
sofa
cushions
to
see
with
my
clothes
up
and
the
<UNK>
tons
of
them
at
night

the
<UNK>
<UNK>
i
couldnt
read
a
line

she
didnt
put
her
address
right
on
it
either
she
may
have
noticed
her
wogger
people

always
going
away
and
we
never
i
remember
that
day
with
the
waves
and
the
boats
with
their
high
heads
rocking
and
the
smell
of
ship
those
officers
<UNK>
on
shore
leave
made
me
<UNK>
he
didnt
say
anything
he
was
very
serious
i
had
the
high
buttoned
boots
on
and
my
skirt
was
blowing
she
kissed
me
six
or
seven
times
didnt
i
cry
yes
i
believe
i
did
or
near
it
my
lips
were
<UNK>
when
i
said
goodbye
she
had
a
gorgeous
wrap
of
some
special
kind
of
blue
colour
on
her
for
the
voyage
made
very
<UNK>
to
one
side
like
and
it
was
extremely
pretty
it
got
as
dull
as
the
devil
after
they
went
i
was
almost
<UNK>
to
run
away
mad
out
of
it
somewhere
were
never
easy
where
we
are
father
or
aunt
or
marriage
waiting
always
waiting
to
<UNK>
him
<UNK>
me
waiting
nor
<UNK>
his
flying
feet
their
damn
guns
<UNK>
and
booming
all
over
the
shop
especially
the
queens
birthday
and
throwing
everything
down
in
all
directions
if
you
didnt
open
the
windows
when
general
ulysses
grant
whoever
he
was
or
did
supposed
to
be
some
great
fellow
landed
off
the
ship
and
old
<UNK>
the
<UNK>
that
was
there
from
before
the
flood
dressed
up
poor
man
and
he
in
mourning
for
the
son
then
the
same
old
<UNK>
for
<UNK>
in
the
morning
and
drums
rolling
and
the
unfortunate
poor
devils
of
soldiers
walking
about
with
<UNK>
smelling
the
place
more
than
the
old
<UNK>
jews
in
their
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
assembly
and
sound
clear
and
<UNK>
for
the
men
to
cross
the
lines
and
the
<UNK>
marching
with
his
keys
to
lock
the
gates
and
the
<UNK>
and
only
captain
<UNK>
and
father
talking
about
rorkes
drift
and
plevna
and
sir
<UNK>
<UNK>
and
gordon
at
<UNK>
lighting
their
pipes
for
them
<UNK>
they
went
out
drunken
old
devil
with
his
grog
on
the
<UNK>
catch
him
leaving
any
of
it
picking
his
nose
trying
to
think
of
some
other
dirty
story
to
tell
up
in
a
corner
but
he
never
forgot
himself
when
i
was
there
sending
me
out
of
the
room
on
some
blind
excuse
paying
his
compliments
the
<UNK>
whisky
talking
of
course
but
hed
do
the
same
to
the
next
woman
that
came
along
i
suppose
he
died
of
galloping
drink
ages
ago
the
days
like
years
not
a
letter
from
a
living
soul
except
the
odd
few
i
posted
to
myself
with
bits
of
paper
in
them
so
<UNK>
sometimes
i
could
fight
with
my
nails
listening
to
that
old
<UNK>
with
the
one
eye
and
his
<UNK>
of
an
instrument
singing
his
<UNK>
<UNK>
<UNK>
all
my
<UNK>
on
your
<UNK>
of
your
<UNK>
as
bad
as
now
with
the

hanging
off
me
looking
out
of
the

was
a
nice
fellow
even
in
the
opposite
house

up
on
a
big
poster
for
them
not
even
if
you
shake
hands
twice
with
the
left
he
didnt
recognise
me
either
when
i
half
frowned
at
him
outside
westland
row
chapel
where
does
their
great
intelligence
come
in
id
like
to
know
grey
matter

sight
less

were
selling
the
meat
and
the
<UNK>
bell
that
noisy
bugger
trying
to
swindle
me

out
of
his

what
a
pair
of
paws
and
pots
and
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
to

any
broken

she
stood
there
standing
when
i
asked

i
pointing
at

i
couldnt
think
of
the
word
a
hairpin
to
open

with
ah
<UNK>
<UNK>
old
thing
and
it
staring
her
in
the

with
her
switch
of
false
hair
on
her
and
vain
about
her
appearance
ugly
as
she
was
near
<number>
or
a
<number>
her
face
a
mass
of
wrinkles
with
all
her

<UNK>
because
she
never
could
get
over
the
<UNK>
fleet
coming
in
half
the
ships
of
the
world
and
the
union
jack
flying
with
all
her
<UNK>
because
<number>
drunken
english
sailors
took
all
the

from
them
and
because
i
didnt
run
into
mass
often
enough
in
santa
maria
to
please
her
with
her
shawl
up
on
her
except
when
there
was
a
marriage
on
with
all
her
miracles
of
the
saints
and
her
black
blessed
virgin
with
the
silver
dress
and
the
sun
dancing
<number>
times
on
easter
sunday
morning
and
when
the

was
going
by
with
the

bringing
the

i
wanted
to

him
up
when
i
saw
him
following
me
along
the
calle
real
in
the
shop
window
then
he
tipped
me
just
in
passing
but
i
never
thought

making
an
appointment

had
it
inside
my
petticoat
<UNK>
all

and
corner
while

was
up
at

old
stupid
clock
to
near
the
time
he
was
the
first
man
kissed
me
under
the
moorish
wall
my
sweetheart
when
a
boy
it
never
entered
my
head
what
kissing
meant
till
he
put
his
tongue
in
my
mouth
his
mouth
was
<UNK>
young
i
put
my
knee
up
to
him
a
few
times
to
learn
the

i
tell
him

about
myself
just
for
him
to

got
him

crushed
all
the
flowers
on
my
bosom
he
brought
me

and
the
<UNK>
till

may
when
the
infant
king
of
spain

on
the
tiptop
under
the
<UNK>
near
<UNK>
tower

struck
by
lightning
and
all
about
the
old
<UNK>
apes
they
sent
to
<UNK>
without
a
tail
<UNK>
all
over
the
show
on

others
back
mrs

she
was
a
regular
old
rock
<UNK>
robbing
the
chickens
out
of

farm
and
throw
stones
at
you
if
you
went
anear
he
was
looking
at
me
i
had
that
white
blouse
on
open
in
the
front
to
encourage
him
as
much
as
i
could
without
too
openly
they
were
just
beginning
to
be
plump
i
said
i
was
tired
we
lay
over
the
<UNK>
cove
a
wild
place
i
suppose
it
must
be
the
highest
rock
in
existence
the
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
and
those
frightful
rocks
and
saint
michaels
cave
with
the
<UNK>
or
whatever
they
call
them
hanging
down
and
<UNK>
all
the
mud
<UNK>
my
boots
im
sure
thats
the
way
down
the
monkeys
go
under
the
sea
to
africa
when
they
die
the
ships
out
far
like
chips
that
was
the
<UNK>
boat
passing
yes
the
sea
and
the
sky
you
could
do
what
you
liked
lie
there
for
ever
he
caressed
them
outside
they
love
doing
that
its
the
<UNK>
there
i
was
leaning
over
him
with
my
white
<UNK>
hat
to
take
the
<UNK>
out
of
it
the
left
side
of
my
face
the
best
my
blouse
open
for
his
last
day
transparent
kind
of
shirt
he
had
i
could
see
his
chest
pink
he
wanted
to
touch
mine
with
his
for
a
moment
but
i
wouldnt
let
him
he
was
awfully
put
out
first
for
fear
you
never
know
consumption
or
leave
me
with
a
child
<UNK>
that
old
servant
<UNK>
told
me
that
one
drop
even
if
it
got
into
you
at
all
after
i
tried
with
the
<UNK>
but
i
was
afraid
it
might
break
and
get
lost
up
in
me
somewhere
because
they
once
took
something
down
out
of
a
woman
that
was
up
there
for
years
covered
with
<UNK>
theyre
all
mad
to
get
in
there
where
they
come
out
of
youd
think
they
could
never
go
far
enough
up
and
then
theyre
done
with
you
in
a
way
till
the
next
time
yes
because
theres
a
wonderful
feeling
there
so
tender
all
the
time
how
did
we
finish
it
off
yes
o
yes
i
pulled
him
off
into
my
handkerchief
pretending
not
to
be
excited
but
i
opened
my
legs
i
wouldnt
let
him
touch
me
inside
my
petticoat
because
i
had
a
skirt
opening
up
the
side
i
<UNK>
the
life
out
of
him
first
tickling
him
i
loved
<UNK>
that
dog
in
the
hotel
<UNK>
<UNK>
his
eyes
shut
and
a
bird
flying
below
us
he
was
shy
all
the
same
i
liked
him
like
that
moaning
i
made
him
blush
a
little
when
i
got
over
him
that
way
when
i
unbuttoned
him
and
took
his
out
and
drew
back
the
skin
it
had
a
kind
of
eye
in
it
theyre
all
buttons
men
down
the
middle
on
the
wrong
side
of

<UNK>

like
millys
little

now
when

runs
up
the

i
loved
looking
down
at

i
was
jumping
up
at
the
pepper

and
the
white
poplars
pulling
the

off

throwing
them
at
him
he

and
the

harry

to
slip
down
at
the
<UNK>

for
the
smell
of
him

no
decent
perfume
to
be
got
in
that
gibraltar

that
cheap
<UNK>
<UNK>
that
faded
and

a
stink

me
that
clumsy
<UNK>

killed
him
with
their
war

all
the
same
as

it
brought
its
bad
luck
with
it
like
an
opal
or
pearl
still
it
must
have
been
pure
<number>
<UNK>
gold
because
it
was
very
heavy
but
what
could
you
get
in
a
place
like
that
the

i
took
with
my
cup
of
tea

good
with
the

i
couldnt
smell
anything
off
it
im
sure
that
<UNK>
man
in
the
porkbutchers
is
a
great
rogue
i
hope
that
lamp
is
not
smoking
fill
my
nose
up
with
<UNK>
better
than
having
him
leaving
the
gas
on
all
night
i
couldnt
rest
easy
in
my
bed
in
gibraltar
even
getting
up
to
see
why
am
i
so
damned
nervous
about
that
though
i
like
it
in
the
winter
its
more
company
o
lord
it
was
rotten
cold
too
that
winter
when
i
was
only
about
ten
was
i
yes
i
had
the
big
doll
with
all
the
funny
clothes
dressing
her
up
and
<UNK>
that
<UNK>
wind
<UNK>
across
from
those
mountains
the
something
<UNK>
<UNK>
<UNK>
standing
at
the
fire
with
the
little
bit
of
a
short
shift
i
had
up
to
heat
myself
i
loved
dancing
about
in
it
then
make
a
race
back
into
bed
im
sure
that
fellow
opposite
used
to
be
there
the
whole
time
watching
with
the
lights
out
in
the
summer
and
i
in
my
skin
hopping
around
i
used
to
love
myself
then
stripped
at
the
washstand
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
only
when
it
came
to
the
chamber
performance
i
put
out
the
light
too
so
then
there
were
<number>
of
us
goodbye
to
my
sleep
for
this
night
anyhow
i
hope
hes
not
going
to
get
in
with
those
medicals
leading
him
astray
to
imagine
hes
young
again
coming
in
at
<number>
in
the
morning
it
must
be
if
not
more
still
he
had
the
manners
not
to
wake
me
what
do
they
find
to
<UNK>
about
all
night
<UNK>
money
and

his
orders
for

<UNK>
and

buttered
toast

him
sitting
up
like
the
king
of
the
country
<UNK>
the
wrong
end
of
the
spoon
up
and
down
in
his
egg
wherever
he
learned
that
from
and
i
love
to
hear
him
falling
up
the
stairs
of
a
morning
with
the
cups
rattling
on
the
tray
and
then
play
with
the
cat
she

you
for
her
own
sake
i
wonder

she
<UNK>
shes
as
bad
as
a
woman
always
licking

<UNK>
but
i
hate
their
claws
i
wonder

they
see
anything

we
cant
staring
like
that
when
she
sits
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
so
long
and

and
<UNK>
some
other
woman
for
him
who
mrs

and
drove
out
to
the
<UNK>
glen
or
the
strawberry
beds

have
him
examining

with
some
cold
veal

but
id
never
again
in
this
life
get
into
a
boat
with
him
after
him
at
bray
telling
the
boatman
he
knew
how
to
row
if
anyone
asked
could
he
ride
the
<UNK>
for
the
gold
cup
hed
say
yes
then
it
came
on
to
get
rough
the
old
thing
<UNK>
about

the
weight
all
down
my
side
telling
me
pull
the
right
reins
now
pull
the
left
and
the

<UNK>
in
<UNK>
in

and
give
him
what
that
one

<UNK>
till
he
was

in
the
world
only
for

who
he
is
with
that
other

burke
out

sweets
of
sin
by
a
gentleman

some
other
mr
de
kock

couldnt
even
change
my

with
the
<UNK>
and
the
hat
i
had
with
that
feather
all
<UNK>
and
tossed
on
me
how
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
because
the
smell
of
the
sea
excited
me
of
course
the
sardines
and
the
<UNK>
in
<UNK>
bay
round
the
back
of
the
rock

fine
all
silver
in
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
old
<UNK>
near
a
hundred
they

the
tall
old
chap
with
the
<UNK>
i
dont
like
a
man
you
have
to
climb
up
to
to
get
at
i
suppose

all
dead
and
rotten
long
ago
besides
i
dont
like
being
alone
in
this
big
barracks
of
a
place
at
night
i
suppose
ill
have
to
put
up
with
it
i
never
brought
a
bit
of
salt
in
even
when
we
moved
in
the
confusion
musical
academy
he
was
going
to
make
on
the
first
floor
drawingroom
with
a
<UNK>
or
blooms
private
hotel
he
suggested
go
and
ruin
himself
altogether
the
way
his
father
did
down
in
ennis
like
all
the
things
he
told
father
he
was
going
to
do
and
me
but
i
saw
through
him
telling
me
all
the
lovely
places
we
could
go
for
the
honeymoon
<UNK>
by
moonlight
with
the
<UNK>
and
the
lake
of
<UNK>
he
had
a
picture

out
of
some
paper
of

<UNK>
and
lanterns
o
how
nice
i
said
whatever
i
liked
he
was
going
to
do
immediately
if
not
sooner
will
you
be
my
man
will
you
carry
my
can
he
ought
to
get
a
leather
medal
with
a
putty
rim
for
all
the
plans
he
<UNK>
then
leaving
us
here
all
day
youd
never
know
what
old
beggar
at
the
door
for
a
crust
with
his
long
story
might
be
a
tramp
and
put
his
foot
in
the
way
to
prevent
me
<UNK>
it
like
that
picture
of
that
<UNK>
criminal
he
was
called
in
<UNK>
weekly
news
<number>
years
in
jail
then
he
comes
out
and
<UNK>
an
old
woman
for
her
money
imagine
his
poor
wife
or
mother
or
whoever
she
is
such
a
face
youd
run
miles
away
from
i
couldnt
rest
easy
till
i
<UNK>
all
the
doors
and
windows
to
make
sure
but
its
worse
again
being
locked
up
like
in
a
prison
or
a
<UNK>
they
ought
to
be
all
shot
or
the
cat
of
nine
tails
a
big
brute
like
that
that
would
attack
a
poor
old
woman
to
murder
her
in
her
bed
id
cut
them
off
him
so
i
would
not
that
hed
be
much
use
still
better
than
nothing
the
night
i
was
sure
i
heard
<UNK>
in
the
kitchen
and
he
went
down
in
his
shirt
with
a
candle
and
a
poker
as
if
he
was
looking
for
a
mouse
as
white
as
a
sheet
<UNK>
out
of
his
wits
making
as
much
noise
as
he
possibly
could
for
the
<UNK>
benefit
there
isnt
much
to
steal
indeed
the
lord
knows
still
its
the
feeling
especially
now
with
milly
away
such
an
idea
for
him
to
send
the
girl
down
there
to
learn
to
take
photographs
on
account
of
his
grandfather
instead
of
sending
her
to
<UNK>
academy
where
shed
have
to
learn
not
like
me
getting
all
at
school
only
hed
do
a
thing
like
that
all
the
same
on
account
of
me
and
boylan
thats
why
he
did
it
im
certain
the
way
he
<UNK>
and
plans
everything
out
i
couldnt
turn
round
with
her
in
the
place
lately
unless
i
<UNK>
the
door
first
gave
me
the
fidgets
coming
in
without
knocking
first
when
i
put
the
chair
against
the
door
just
as
i
was
washing
myself
there
below
with
the
glove
get
on
your
nerves
then
doing
the
<UNK>
all
day
put
her
in
a
<UNK>
with
two
at
a
time
to
look
at
her
if
he
knew
she
broke
off
the
hand
off
that
little
<UNK>
statue
with
her
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
before
she

italian

join

<number>
shillings

potatoes

you
of
course

right
not
to
ruin
her
hands
i
noticed
he
was
always
talking
to
her
lately
at
the
table
explaining
things
in
the
paper
and
she
pretending
to
understand
sly
of
course
that
comes
from
his
side
of
the
house
he
cant
say
i
pretend
things
can
he
im
too
honest
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
helping
her
into
her
coat
but
if
there
was
anything
wrong
with
her
its
me
shed
tell
not
him
i
suppose
he
thinks
im
finished
out
and
laid
on
the
shelf
well
im
not
no
nor
anything
like
it
well
see
well
see
now

well
on
for
flirting
too
with
tom
devans
two
sons
imitating
me
whistling
with
those
<UNK>
of
murray
girls
calling
for
her
can
milly
come
out
please
shes
in
great
<UNK>
to
pick
what
they
can
out
of
her
round
in
nelson
street
riding
harry
devans
bicycle
at
night
its
as
well
he
sent
her
where
she
is
she
was
just
getting
out
of
bounds
wanting
to
go
on
the
<UNK>
and
smoking
their
cigarettes
through
their
nose
i
smelt
it
off
her
dress
when
i
was
biting
off
the
thread
of
the
button
i
<UNK>
on
to
the
bottom
of
her
jacket
she
couldnt
hide
much
from
me
i
tell
you
only
i
oughtnt
to
have
stitched
it
and
it
on
her
it
brings
a
parting
and
the
last
<UNK>
too
split
in
<number>
halves
see
it
comes
out
no
matter
what
they
say
her
tongue
is
a
bit
too
long
for
my
taste
your
blouse
is
open
too
low
she
says
to
me
the
pan
calling
the
kettle
<UNK>
and
i
had
to
tell
her
not
to
cock
her
legs
up
like
that
on
show
on
the
<UNK>
before
all
the
people
passing
they
all
look
at
her
like
me
when
i
was
her
age
of
course
any
old
rag
looks
well
on
you
then
a
great
<UNK>
too
in
her
own
way
at
the
only
way
in
the
theatre
royal
take
your
foot
away
out
of
that
i
hate
people
touching
me
afraid
of
her
life
id
crush
her
skirt
with
the
pleats
a
lot
of
that
touching
must
go
on
in
<UNK>
in
the
crush
in
the
dark
theyre
always
trying
to
<UNK>
up
to
you
that
fellow
in
the
pit
at
the
gaiety
for
<UNK>
tree
in
<UNK>
the
last
time
ill
ever
go
there
to
be
squashed
like
that
for
any
<UNK>
or
her
<UNK>
every
two
minutes
tipping
me
there
and
looking
away
hes
a
bit
<UNK>
i
think
i
saw
him
after
trying
to
get
near
two
<UNK>
ladies
outside
<UNK>
window
at
the
same
little
game
i
recognised
him
on
the
moment
the
face
and
everything
but
he
didnt
remember
me
yes
and
she
didnt
even
want
me
to
kiss
her
at
the
broadstone
going
away
well
i
hope
shell
get
someone
to
dance
attendance
on
her
the
way
i
did
when
she
was
down
with
the
<UNK>
and
her
glands
swollen
wheres
this
and
wheres
that
of
course
she
cant
feel
anything
deep
yet
i
never
came
properly
till
i
was
what
<number>
or
so
it
went
into
the
wrong
place
always
only
the
usual
girls
nonsense
and
giggling
that
<UNK>
<UNK>
writing
to
her
in
white
ink
on
black
paper
sealed
with
<UNK>
though
she
clapped
when
the
curtain
came
down
because
he
looked
so
handsome
then
we
had
martin
harvey
for
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
i
thought
to
myself
afterwards
it
must
be
real
love
if
a
man
gives
up
his
life
for
her
that
way
for
nothing
i
suppose
there
are
a
few
men
like
that
left
its
hard
to
believe
in
it
though
unless
it
really
happened
to
me
the
majority
of
them
with
not
a
<UNK>
of
love
in
their
natures
to
find
two
people
like
that
<UNK>
full
up
of
each
other
that
would
feel
the
same
way
as
you
do
theyre
usually
a
bit
foolish
in
the
head
his
father
must
have
been
a
bit
queer
to
go
and
poison
himself
after
her
still
poor
old
man
i
suppose
he
felt
lost
shes
always
making
love
to
my
things
too
the
few
old
rags
i
have
wanting
to
put
her
hair
up
at
<number>
my
powder
too
only
ruin
her
skin
on
her
shes
time
enough
for
that
all
her
life
after
of
course
shes
<UNK>
knowing
shes
pretty
with
her
lips
so
red
a
pity
they
wont
stay
that
way
i
was
too
but
theres
no
use
going
to
the
fair
with
the
thing
answering
me
like
a
<UNK>
when
i
asked
to
go
for
a
half
a
stone
of
potatoes
the
day
we
met
mrs
joe
gallaher
at
the
<UNK>
and
she
pretended
not
to
see
us
in
her
<UNK>
with
<UNK>
the
solicitor
we
werent
grand
enough
till
i
gave
her
<number>
damn
fine
cracks
across
the
ear
for
herself
take
that
now
for
answering
me
like
that
and
that
for
your
impudence
she
had
me
that
<UNK>
of
course
<UNK>
i
was
<UNK>
too
because
how
was
it
there
was
a
weed
in
the
tea
or
i
didnt
sleep
the
night
before
cheese
i
ate
was
it
and
i
told
her
over
and
over
again
not
to
leave
knives
crossed
like
that
because
she
has
nobody
to
command
her
as
she
said
herself
well
if
he
doesnt
correct
her
faith
i
will
that
was
the
last
time
she
turned
on
the
<UNK>
i
was
just
like
that
myself
they
darent
order
me
about
the
place
its
his
fault
of
course
having
the
two
of
us
<UNK>
here
instead
of
getting
in
a
woman
long
ago
am
i
ever
going
to
have
a
proper
servant
again
of
course
then
shed
see
him
coming
id
have
to
let
her
know
or
shed
revenge
it
arent
they
a
nuisance
that
old
mrs
fleming
you
have
to
be
walking
round
after
her
putting
the
things
into
her
hands
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
into
the
pots
well
of
course
shes
old
she
cant
help
it
a
good
job
i
found
that
rotten
old
<UNK>
<UNK>
that
got
lost
behind
the
dresser
i
knew
there
was
something
and
opened
the
area
window
to
let
out
the
smell
bringing
in
his
friends
to
<UNK>
them
like
the
night
he
walked
home
with
a
dog
if
you
please
that
might
have
been
mad
especially
simon
dedalus
son
his
father
such
a
<UNK>
with
his
glasses
up
with
his
tall
hat
on
him
at
the
cricket
match
and
a
great
big
hole
in
his
sock
one
thing
laughing
at
the
other
and
his
son
that
got
all
those
prizes
for
whatever
he
won
them
in
the
intermediate
imagine
climbing
over
the
railings
if
anybody
saw
him
that
knew
us
i
wonder
he
didnt
tear
a
big
hole
in
his
grand
funeral
trousers
as
if
the
one
nature
gave
wasnt
enough
for
anybody
<UNK>
him
down
into
the
dirty
old
kitchen
now
is
he
right
in
his
head
i
ask
pity
it
wasnt
washing
day
my
old
pair
of
drawers
might
have
been
hanging
up
too
on
the
line
on
exhibition
for
all

ever
care
with
the
<UNK>
mark
the
stupid
old
bundle

think

even
rendered
down

fat

as

in
a
box
that
michael
gunn
gave
him
to
see
mrs
kendal
and
her
husband
at
the
gaiety
something
he
did
about
insurance
for
him
in
drimmies
i
was
fit
to
be
tied
though
i
wouldnt
give
in
with
that
gentleman
of
fashion
staring
down
at
me
with
his
glasses
and
him
the
other
side
of
me
talking
about
spinoza
and
his
soul
thats
dead
i
suppose
millions
of
years
ago
i
smiled
the
best
i
could
all
in
a
<UNK>
leaning
forward
as
if
i
was
interested
having
to
sit
it
out
then
to
the
last
tag
i
wont
forget
that
wife
of
<UNK>
in
a
hurry
supposed
to
be
a
fast
play
about
adultery
that
idiot
in
the
gallery
<UNK>
the
woman
adulteress
he
shouted
i
suppose
he
went
and
had
a
woman
in
the
next
lane
running
round
all
the
back
ways
after
to
make
up
for
it
i
wish
he
had
what
i
had
then
hed
<UNK>
i
bet
the
cat
itself
is
better
off
than
us
have
we
too
much
blood
up
in
us
or
what
o
patience
above
its
pouring
out
of
me
like
the
sea
anyhow
he
didnt
make
me
<UNK>
as
big
as
he
is
i
dont
want
to
ruin
the
clean
sheets
i
just
put
on
i
suppose
the
clean
linen
i
wore
brought
it
on
too
damn
it
damn
it
and
they
always
want
to
see
a
stain
on
the
bed
to
know
youre
a
virgin
for
them
all
thats
<UNK>
them
theyre
such
fools
too
you
could
be
a
widow
or
divorced
<number>
times
over
a
<UNK>
of
red
ink
would
do
or
<UNK>
juice
no
thats
too
<UNK>
o
<UNK>
let
me
up
out
of
this
pooh
sweets
of
sin
whoever
suggested
that
business
for
women
what
between
clothes
and
cooking
and
children
this
damned
old
bed
too
jingling
like
the
<UNK>
i
suppose
they
could
hear
us
away
over
the
other
side
of
the
park
till
i
suggested
to
put
the
quilt
on
the
floor
with
the
pillow
under
my
bottom
i
wonder
is
it
nicer
in
the
day
i
think
it
is
easy
i
think
ill
cut
all
this
hair
off
me
there
<UNK>
me
i
might
look
like
a
young
girl
wouldnt
he
get
the
great
<UNK>
the
next
time
he
turned
up
my
clothes
on
me
id
give
anything
to
see
his
face
wheres
the
chamber
gone
easy
ive
a
holy
horror
of
its
breaking
under
me
after
that
old
commode
i
wonder
was
i
too
heavy
sitting
on
his
knee
i
made
him
sit
on
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
when
i
took
off
only
my
blouse
and
skirt
first
in
the
other
room
he
was
so
busy
where
he
oughtnt
to
be
he
never
felt
me
i
hope
my
breath
was
sweet
after
those
kissing
comfits
easy
god
i
remember
one
time
i
could
<UNK>
it
out
straight
whistling
like
a
man
almost
easy
o
lord
how
noisy
i
hope
theyre
<UNK>
on
it
for
a
<UNK>
of
money
from
some
fellow
ill
have
to
perfume
it
in
the
morning
dont
forget
i
bet
he
never
saw
a
better
pair
of
thighs
than
that
look
how
white
they
are
the
<UNK>
place
is
right
there
between
this
bit
here
how
soft
like
a
<UNK>
easy
god
i
wouldnt
mind
being
a
man
and
get
up
on
a
lovely
woman
o
lord
what
a
row
youre
making
like
the
jersey
lily
easy
easy
o
how
the
waters
come
down
at
<UNK>
who
knows
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
my
insides
or
have
i
something
growing
in
me
getting
that
thing
like
that
every
week
when
was
it
last
i
whit
monday
yes
its
only
about
<number>
weeks
i
ought
to
go
to
the
doctor
only
it
would
be
like
before
i
married
him
when
i
had
that
white
thing
coming
from
me
and
floey
made
me
go
to
that
dry
old
stick
dr
collins
for
womens
<UNK>
on
pembroke
road
your
<UNK>
he
called
it
i
suppose
thats
how
he
got
all
the
gilt
mirrors
and
<UNK>
getting
round
those
rich
ones
off
stephens
green
running
up
to
him
for
every
little
<UNK>
her
<UNK>
and
her
<UNK>
theyve
money
of
course
so
theyre
all
right
i
wouldnt
marry
him
not
if
he
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
besides
theres
something
queer
about
their
children
always
smelling
around
those
filthy
bitches
all
sides
asking
me
if
what
i
did
had
an
<UNK>
odour
what
did
he
want
me
to
do
but
the
one
thing
gold
maybe
what
a
question
if
i
<UNK>
it
all
over
his
<UNK>
old
face
for
him
with
all
my
<UNK>
i
suppose
hed
know
then
and
could
you
pass
it
easily
pass
what
i
thought
he
was
talking
about
the
rock
of
gibraltar
the
way
he
put
it
thats
a
very
nice
invention
too
by
the
way
only
i
like
letting
myself
down
after
in
the
hole
as
far
as
i
can
squeeze
and
pull
the
chain
then
to
flush
it
nice
cool
pins
and
needles
still
theres
something
in
it
i
suppose
i
always
used
to
know
by
millys
when
she
was
a
child
whether
she
had
<UNK>
or
not
still
all
the
same
paying
him
for
that
how
much
is
that
doctor
one
guinea
please
and
asking
me
had
i
frequent
<UNK>
where
do
those
old
fellows
get
all
the
words
they
have
<UNK>
with
his
shortsighted
eyes
on
me
cocked
sideways
i
wouldnt
trust
him
too
far
to
give
me
chloroform
or
god
knows
what
else
still
i
liked
him
when
he
sat
down
to
write
the
thing
out
frowning
so
severe
his
nose
intelligent
like
that
you
be
damned
you
lying
strap
o
anything
no
matter
who
except
an
idiot
he
was
clever
enough
to
spot
that
of
course
that
was
all
thinking
of
him
and
his
mad
crazy
letters
my
precious
one
everything
connected
with
your
glorious
body
everything
<UNK>
that
comes
from
it
is
a
thing
of
beauty
and
of
joy
for
ever
something
he
got
out
of
some
<UNK>
book
that
he
had
me
always
at
myself
<number>
and
<number>
times
a
day
sometimes
and
i
said
i
hadnt
are
you
sure
o
yes
i
said
i
am
quite
sure
in
a
way
that
shut
him
up
i
knew
what
was
coming
next
only
natural
weakness
it
was
he
excited
me
i
dont
know
how
the
first
night
ever
we
met
when
i
was
living
in
<UNK>
terrace
we
stood
staring
at
one
another
for
about
<number>
minutes
as
if
we
met
somewhere
i
suppose
on
account
of
my
being
<UNK>
looking
after
my
mother
he
used
to
<UNK>
me
the
things
he
said
with
the
half
<UNK>
smile
on
him
and
all
the
doyles
said
he
was
going
to
stand
for
a
member
of
parliament
o
wasnt
i
the
born
fool
to
believe
all
his
<UNK>
about
home
rule
and
the
land
league
sending
me
that
long
<UNK>
of
a
song
out
of
the
huguenots
to
sing
in
french
to
be
more
<UNK>
o
beau
pays
de
la
<UNK>
that
i
never
even
sang
once
explaining
and
<UNK>
about
religion
and
persecution
he
wont
let
you
enjoy
anything
naturally
then
might
he
as
a
great
favour
the
very
1st
opportunity
he
got
a
chance
in
<UNK>
square
running
into
my
bedroom
pretending
the
ink
got
on
his
hands
to
wash
it
off
with
the
albion
milk
and
sulphur
soap
i
used
to
use
and
the
<UNK>
still
round
it
o
i
laughed
myself
sick
at
him
that
day
i
better
not
make
an
<UNK>
sitting
on
this
affair
they
ought
to
make
chambers
a
natural
size
so
that
a
woman
could
sit
on
it
properly
he
<UNK>
down
to
do
it
i
suppose
there
isnt
in
all
creation
another
man
with
the
habits
he
has
look
at
the
way
hes
sleeping
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
how
can
he
without
a
hard
bolster
its
well
he
doesnt
kick
or
he
might
knock
out
all
my
teeth
breathing
with
his
hand
on
his
nose
like
that
indian
god
he
took
me
to
show
one
wet
sunday
in
the
museum
in
kildare
street
all
yellow
in
a
<UNK>
lying
on
his
side
on
his
hand
with
his
ten
toes
sticking
out
that
he
said
was
a
bigger
religion
than
the
jews
and
our
lords
both
put
together
all
over
asia
imitating
him
as
hes
always
imitating
everybody
i
suppose
he
used
to
sleep
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
too
with
his
big
square
feet
up
in
his
wifes
mouth
damn
this
stinking
thing
anyway
wheres
this
those
napkins
are
ah
yes
i
know
i
hope
the
old
press
doesnt
<UNK>
ah
i
knew
it
would
hes
sleeping
hard
had
a
good
time
somewhere
still
she
must
have
given
him
great
value
for
his
money
of
course
he
has
to
pay
for
it
from
her
o
this
nuisance
of
a
thing
i
hope
theyll
have
something
better
for
us
in
the
other
world
<UNK>
ourselves
up
god
help
us
thats
all
right
for
tonight
now
the
<UNK>
old
<UNK>
bed
always
reminds
me
of
old
cohen
i
suppose
he
scratched
himself
in
it
often
enough
and
he
thinks
father
bought
it
from
lord
<UNK>
that
i
used
to
admire
when
i
was
a
little
girl
because
i
told
him
easy
piano
o
i
like
my
bed
god
here
we
are
as
bad
as
ever
after
<number>
years
how
many
houses
were
we
in
at
all
<UNK>
terrace
and
ontario
terrace
and
lombard
street
and
holles
street
and
he
goes
about
whistling
every
time
were
on
the
run
again
his
huguenots
or
the
<UNK>
march
pretending
to
help
the
men
with
our
<number>
sticks
of
furniture
and
then
the
city
arms
hotel
worse
and
worse
says
<UNK>
<UNK>
that
charming
place
on
the
landing
always
somebody
inside
praying
then
leaving
all
their
stinks
after
them
always
know
who
was
in
there
last
every
time
were
just
getting
on
right
something
happens
or
he
puts
his
big
foot
in
it
thoms
and
helys
and
mr
cuffes
and
drimmies
either
hes
going
to
be
run
into
prison
over
his
old
lottery
tickets
that
was
to
be
all
our
<UNK>
or
he
goes
and
gives
impudence
well
have
him
coming
home
with
the
sack
soon
out
of
the
freeman
too
like
the
rest
on
account
of
those
sinner
fein
or
the
<UNK>
then
well
see
if
the
little
man
he
showed
me
dribbling
along
in
the
wet
all
by
himself
round
by
<UNK>
lane
will
give
him
much
consolation
that
he
says
is
so
capable
and
<UNK>
irish
he
is
indeed
<UNK>
by
the
sincerity
of
the
trousers
i
saw
on
him
wait
theres
georges
church
bells
wait
<number>
quarters
the
hour
wait
two
oclock
well
thats
a
nice
hour
of
the
night
for
him
to
be
coming
home
at
to
anybody
climbing
down
into
the
area
if
anybody
saw
him
ill
knock
him
off
that
little
habit
tomorrow
first
ill
look
at
his
shirt
to
see
or
ill
see
if
he
has
that
french
letter
still
in
his
pocketbook
i
suppose
he
thinks
i
dont
know
<UNK>
men
all
their
<number>
pockets
arent
enough
for
their
lies
then
why
should
we
tell
them
even
if
its
the
truth
they
dont
believe
you
then
tucked
up
in
bed
like
those
babies
in
the
<UNK>
masterpiece
he
brought
me
another
time
as
if
we
hadnt
enough
of
that
in
real
life
without
some
old
<UNK>
or
whatever
his
name
is
<UNK>
you
more
with
those
rotten
pictures
children
with
two
heads
and
no
legs
thats
the
kind
of
<UNK>
theyre
always
dreaming
about
with
not
another
thing
in
their
empty
heads
they
ought
to
get
slow
poison
the
half
of
them
then
tea
and
toast
for
him
buttered
on
both
sides
and
newlaid
eggs
i
suppose
im
nothing
any
more
when
i
wouldnt
let
him
lick
me
in
holles
street
one
night
man
man
<UNK>
as
ever
for
the
one
thing
he
slept
on
the
floor
half
the
night
naked
the
way
the
jews
used
when
somebody
dies
belonged
to
them
and
wouldnt
eat
any
breakfast
or
speak
a
word
wanting
to
be
<UNK>
so
i
thought
i
stood
out
enough
for
one
time
and
let
him
he
does
it
all
wrong
too
thinking
only
of
his
own
pleasure
his
tongue
is
too
flat
or
i
dont
know
what
he
forgets
that
<UNK>
i
dont
ill
make
him
do
it
again
if
he
doesnt
mind
himself
and
lock
him
down
to
sleep
in
the
<UNK>
with
the
<UNK>
i
wonder
was
it
her
josie
off
her
head
with
my
<UNK>
hes
such
a
born
liar
too
no
hed
never
have
the
courage
with
a
married
woman
thats
why
he
wants
me
and
boylan
though
as
for
her
denis
as
she
calls
him
that
<UNK>
spectacle

call
him

some
little
bitch

got
in
with
even
when
i
was
with
him

milly
at
the
college
races
that
hornblower
with
the
childs
bonnet
on
the
top
of
his
<UNK>

by
the
back
way
he
was
throwing
his
sheeps
eyes
at
those
two
doing
skirt
duty
up
and
down
i
tried
to
wink
at
him
first
no
use
of
course

thats
the
way
his
money
goes
this
is
the
fruits
of
mr
paddy
dignam

were
all
in
great
style
at
the
grand
funeral
in
the
paper
boylan
brought
in
if
they
saw
a
real
officers
funeral
thatd
be
something
reversed
arms
muffled
drums
the
poor
horse
walking
behind
in
black
l
boom
and
tom
kernan
that
drunken
little
<UNK>
man

bit
his
tongue
off
falling
down

some
place
or
other
and
martin

of
cabbage
skinny
thing
with
a
turn
in
her
eye
trying
to
sing
my
songs
shed
want
to
be
born
all
over
again
and
her
old
green
dress
with
the
<UNK>
as
she
cant
attract
them
any
other
way
like
dabbling
on
a
rainy
day
i
see
it
all
now
plainly
and
they
call
that
friendship
killing
and
then
burying
one
another
and
they
all
with
their
wives
and
families
at
home

or
just
getting
better
of
it
and
hes
a
goodlooking
man
still
though

getting
a
bit
grey
over
the
ears
theyre
a
nice
lot
all
of
them
well
theyre
not
going
to
get
my
husband
again
into
their
clutches
if
i
can
help
it
making
fun
of
him
then
behind
his
back
i
know
well
when
he
goes
on
with
his
<UNK>
because
he
has
sense
enough
not
to
<UNK>
every
penny
piece
he
<UNK>
down
their
<UNK>
and
looks
after
his
wife
and
family
<UNK>
poor
paddy
dignam
all
the
same
im
sorry
in
a
way
for
him
what
are
his
wife
and
<number>
children
going
to
do
unless
he
was
insured
<UNK>
little
<UNK>
always
stuck
up
in
some
pub
corner
and
her
or
her
son
waiting
bill
bailey
wont
you
please
come
home
her
widows
weeds
wont
<UNK>
her
appearance
theyre
awfully
becoming
though
if
youre
goodlooking
what
men
wasnt
he
yes
he
was
at
the
glencree
dinner
and
ben
dollard
base
barreltone
the
night
he
borrowed
the
<UNK>
to
sing
out
of
in
holles
street
<UNK>
and
squashed
into
them
and
grinning
all
over
his
big
dolly
face
like
a
<UNK>
childs
<UNK>
didnt
he
look
a
balmy
ballocks
sure
enough
that
must
have
been
a
spectacle
on
the
stage
imagine
paying
<number>
in
the
preserved
seats
for
that
to
see
him
trotting
off
in
his
<UNK>
and
simon
dedalus
too
he
was
always
turning
up
half
screwed
singing
the
second
verse
first
the
old
love
is
the
new
was
one
of
his
so
sweetly
sang
the
maiden
on
the
hawthorn
<UNK>
he
was
always
on
for
<UNK>
too
when
i
sang
maritana
with
him
at
freddy
<UNK>
private
opera
he
had
a
<UNK>
glorious
voice
<UNK>
dearest
goodbye
sweetheart
sweetheart
he
always
sang
it
not
like
bartell
darcy
sweet
tart
goodbye
of
course
he
had
the
gift
of
the
voice
so
there
was
no
art
in
it
all
over
you
like
a
warm
<UNK>
o
maritana
<UNK>
flower
we
sang
<UNK>
though
it
was
a
bit
too
high
for
my
<UNK>
even
<UNK>
and
he
was
married
at
the
time
to
may
goulding
but
then
hed
say
or
do
something
to
knock
the
good
out
of
it
hes
a
widower
now
i
wonder
what
sort
is
his
son
he
says
hes
an
author
and
going
to
be
a
university
professor
of
italian
and
im
to
take
<UNK>
what
is
he
driving
at
now
showing
him
my
photo
its
not
good
of
me
i
ought
to
have
got
it
taken
in
<UNK>
that
never
looks
out
of
fashion
still
i
look
young
in
it
i
wonder
he
didnt
make
him
a
present
of
it
altogether
and
me
too
after
all
why
not
i
saw
him
driving
down
to
the
<UNK>
station
with
his
father
and
mother
i
was
in
mourning
thats
<number>
years
ago
now
yes
hed
be
<number>
though
what
was
the
good
in
going
into
mourning
for
what
was
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
the
first
cry
was
enough
for
me
i
heard
the
<UNK>
too
ticking
in
the
wall
of
course
he
<UNK>
hed
go
into
mourning
for
the
cat
i
suppose
hes
a
man
now
by
this
time
he
was
an
innocent
boy
then
and
a
darling
little
fellow
in
his
lord
<UNK>
suit
and
curly
hair
like
a
prince
on
the
stage
when
i
saw
him
at
mat
dillons
he
liked
me
too
i
remember
they
all
do
wait
by
god
yes
wait
yes
hold
on
he
was
on
the
cards
this
morning
when
i
laid
out
the
deck
union
with
a
young
stranger
neither
dark
nor
fair
you
met
before
i
thought
it
meant
him
but
hes
no
chicken
nor
a
stranger
either
besides
my
face
was
turned
the
other
way
what
was
the
<UNK>
card
after
that
the
<number>
of
spades
for
a
journey
by
land
then
there
was
a
letter
on
its
way
and
<UNK>
too
the
<number>
queens
and
the
<number>
of
diamonds
for
a
rise
in
society
yes
wait
it
all
came
out
and
<number>
red
<UNK>
for
new
garments
look
at
that
and
didnt
i
dream
something
too
yes
there
was
something
about
poetry
in
it
i
hope
he
hasnt
long
greasy
hair
hanging
into
his
eyes
or
standing
up
like
a
red
indian
what
do
they
go
about
like
that
for
only
getting
themselves
and
their
poetry
laughed
at
i
always
liked
poetry
when
i
was
a
girl
first
i
thought
he
was
a
poet
like
lord
byron
and
not
an
ounce
of
it
in
his
composition
i
thought
he
was
quite
different
i
wonder
is
he
too
young
hes
about
wait
<number>
i
was
married
<number>
milly
is
<number>
yesterday
<number>
what
age
was
he
then
at
dillons
<number>
or
<number>
about
<number>
i
suppose
hes
<number>
or
more
im
not
too
old
for
him
if
hes
<number>
or
<number>
i
hope
hes
not
that
<UNK>
university
student
sort
no
otherwise
he
wouldnt
go
sitting
down
in
the
old
kitchen
with
him
taking
eppss
cocoa
and
talking
of
course
he
pretended
to
understand
it
all
probably
he
told
him
he
was
out
of
trinity
college
hes
very
young
to
be
a
professor
i
hope
hes
not
a
professor
like
goodwin
was
he
was
a
potent
professor
of
john
<UNK>
they
all
write
about
some
woman
in
their
poetry
well
i
suppose
he
wont
find
many
like
me
where
softly
sighs
of
love
the
light
guitar
where
poetry
is
in
the
air
the
blue
sea
and
the
moon
shining
so
beautifully
coming
back
on
the
<UNK>
from
<UNK>
the
<UNK>
at
europa
point
the
guitar
that
fellow
played
was
so
expressive
will
i
ever
go
back
there
again
all
new
faces
two
glancing
eyes
a
lattice
hid
ill
sing
that
for
him
theyre
my
eyes
if
hes
anything
of
a
poet
two
eyes
as
darkly
bright
as
loves
own
star
arent
those
beautiful
words
as
loves
young
star
itll
be
a
change
the
lord
knows
to
have
an
intelligent
person
to
talk
to
about
yourself
not
always
listening
to
him
and
billy
prescotts
ad
and
keyess
ad
and
tom
the
devils
ad
then
if
anything
goes
wrong
in
their
business
we
have
to
suffer
im
sure
hes
very
distinguished
id
like
to
meet
a
man
like
that
god
not
those
other
ruck
besides
hes
young
those
fine
young
men
i
could
see
down
in
margate
strand
<UNK>
from
the
side
of
the
rock
standing
up
in
the
sun
naked
like
a
god
or
something
and
then
plunging
into
the
sea
with
them
why
arent
all
men
like
that
thered
be
some
consolation
for
a
woman
like
that
lovely
little
statue
he
bought
i
could
look
at
him
all
day
long
curly
head
and
his
shoulders
his
finger
up
for
you
to
listen
theres
real
beauty
and
poetry
for
you
i
often
felt
i
wanted
to
kiss
him
all
over
also
his
lovely
young
cock

simple
i
wouldnt
mind

in
my
mouth
if
nobody

if
it
was
asking
you
to
suck
it
so
clean
and
white
he
looks
with
his
<UNK>
face
i
would
too
in
<number>
a
minute
even

some
of
it
went
down

its
only
like
<UNK>
or
the
dew
theres
no
danger
besides
hed
be
so
clean
compared
with
those
pigs
of
men
i
suppose
never
dream
of
washing
it
from
<number>
years
end
to
the
other
the
most
of
them
only
thats
what
gives
the
women
the
moustaches
im
sure
itll
be
grand
if
i
can
only
get
in
with
a
handsome
young
poet
at
my
age
ill
throw
them
the
1st
thing
in
the
morning
till
i
see
if
the
<UNK>

pairing
the
lady
herself
and
see
if
he
comes
out
ill
read
and
study
all
i
can
find
or
learn
a
bit
off
by
heart
if
i
knew
who
he
likes
so
he
wont
think
me
stupid
if
he
thinks
all
women
are
the
same
and
i
can
teach
him
the
other
part
ill
make
him
feel
all
over
him
till

<UNK>
under
me
then
hell
write
about
me
lover
and
mistress
publicly
too
with
our
<number>
photographs
in
all
the
papers
when
he
becomes
famous
o
but
then
what
am
i
going
to
do
about
him
though
no
thats
no
way
for
him
has
he
no
manners
nor
no
refinement
nor
no
nothing
in
his
nature
slapping
us
behind
like
that
on
my
bottom
because
i
didnt
call
him
hugh
the
<UNK>
that
doesnt
know
poetry
from
a
cabbage
thats
what
you
get
for
not
keeping
them
in
their
proper
place
pulling
off
his
shoes
and
trousers
there
on
the
chair
before
me
so
barefaced
without
even
asking
permission
and
standing
out
that
<UNK>
way
in
the
half
of
a
shirt
they
wear
to
be
admired
like
a
priest
or
a
butcher
or
those
old
<UNK>
in
the
time
of
julius
caesar
of
course
hes
right
enough
in
his
way
to
pass
the
time
as
a
joke
sure
you
might
as
well
be
in
bed
with
what
with
a
lion
god
im
sure
hed
have
something
better
to
say
for
himself
an
old
lion
would
o
well
i
suppose
its
because
they
were
so
plump
and
tempting
in
my
short
petticoat
he
couldnt
resist
they
excite
myself
sometimes
its
well
for
men
all
the
amount
of
pleasure
they
get
off
a
womans
body
were
so
round
and
white
for
them
always
i
wished
i
was
one
myself
for
a
change
just
to
try
with
that
thing
they
have
swelling
up
on
you
so
hard
and
at
the
same
time
so
soft
when
you
touch
it
my
uncle
john
has
a
thing
long
i
heard
those
<UNK>
saying
passing
the
<UNK>
of
<UNK>
lane
my
aunt
mary
has
a
thing
hairy
because
it
was
dark
and
they
knew
a
girl
was
passing
it
didnt
make
me
blush
why
should
it
either
its
only
nature
and
he
puts
his
thing
long
into
my
aunt
marys
hairy
etcetera
and
turns
out
to
be
you
put
the
handle
in
a
<UNK>
men
again
all
over
they
can
pick
and
choose
what
they
please
a
married
woman
or
a
fast
widow
or
a
girl
for
their
different
tastes
like
those
houses
round
behind
irish
street
no
but
were
to
be
always
<UNK>
up
theyre
not
going
to
be
<UNK>
me
up
no
damn
fear
once
i
start
i
tell
you
for
their
stupid
husbands
jealousy
why
cant
we
all
remain
friends
over
it
instead
of
quarrelling
her
husband
found
it
out
what
they
did
together
well
naturally
and
if
he
did
can
he
<UNK>
it
hes
<UNK>
anyway
whatever
he
does
and
then
he
going
to
the
other
mad
extreme
about
the
wife
in
fair
tyrants
of
course
the
man
never
even
<UNK>
a
2nd
thought
on
the
husband
or
wife
either
its
the
woman
he
wants
and
he
gets
her
what
else
were
we
given
all
those
desires
for
id
like
to
know
i
cant
help
it
if
im
young
still
can
i
its
a
wonder
im
not
an
old
shrivelled
hag
before
my
time
living
with
him
so
cold
never
embracing
me
except
sometimes
when
hes
asleep
the
wrong
end
of
me
not
knowing
i
suppose
who
he
has
any
man
thatd
kiss
a
womans
bottom
id
throw
my
hat
at
him
after
that
hed
kiss
anything
<UNK>
where
we
havent
<number>
<UNK>
of
any
kind
of
expression
in
us
all
of
us
the
same
<number>
lumps
of
lard
before
ever
id
do
that
to
a
man
<UNK>
the
dirty
brutes
the
mere
thought
is
enough
i
kiss
the
feet
of
you
<UNK>
theres
some
sense
in
that
didnt
he
kiss
our
halldoor
yes
he
did
what
a
<UNK>
nobody
understands
his
cracked
ideas
but
me
still
of
course
a
woman
wants
to
be
<UNK>
<number>
times
a
day
almost
to
make
her
look
young
no
matter
by
who
so
long
as
to
be
in
love
or
loved
by
somebody
if
the
fellow
you
want
isnt
there
sometimes
by
the
lord
god
i
was
thinking
would
i
go
around
by
the
quays
there
some
dark
evening
where
<UNK>
know
me
and
pick
up
a
sailor
off
the
sea
thatd
be
hot
on
for
it
and
not
care
a
pin
whose
i
was
only
do
it
off
up
in
a
gate
somewhere
or
one
of
those
<UNK>
<UNK>
in
<UNK>
had
their
camp
pitched
near
the
bloomfield
laundry
to
try
and
steal
our
things
if
they
could
i
only
sent
mine
there
a
few
times
for
the
name
model
laundry
sending
me
back
over
and
over
some
old
ones
odd
stockings
that
<UNK>
fellow
with
the
fine
eyes
<UNK>
a
switch
attack
me
in
the
dark
and
ride
me
up
against
the
wall
without
a
word
or
a
murderer
anybody
what
they
do
themselves
the
fine
gentlemen
in
their
silk
hats
that
k
c
lives
up
somewhere
this
way
coming
out
of
hardwicke
lane
the
night
he
gave
us
the
fish
supper
on
account
of
winning
over
the
<UNK>
match
of
course
it
was
for
me
he
gave
it
i
knew
him
by
his
<UNK>
and
the
walk
and
when
i
turned
round
a
minute
after
just
to
see
there
was
a
woman
after
coming
out
of
it
too
some
filthy
prostitute
then
he
goes
home
to
his
wife
after
that
only
i
suppose
the
half
of
those
sailors
are
rotten
again
with
disease
o
move
over
your
big
carcass
out
of
that
for
the
love
of
<UNK>
listen
to
him
the
winds
that
<UNK>
my
sighs
to
thee
so
well
he
may
sleep
and
sigh
the
great
<UNK>
don
<UNK>
de
la
flora
if
he
knew
how
he
came
out
on
the
cards
this
morning
hed
have
something
to
sigh
for
a
dark
man
in
some
<UNK>
between
<number>
<UNK>
too
in
prison
for
lord
knows
what
he
does
that
i
dont
know
and
im
to
be
<UNK>
around
down
in
the
kitchen
to
get
his
lordship
his
breakfast
while
hes
rolled
up
like
a
mummy
will
i
indeed
did
you
ever
see
me
running
id
just
like
to
see
myself
at
it
show
them
attention
and
they
treat
you
like
dirt
i
dont
care
what
anybody
says
itd
be
much
better
for
the
world
to
be
<UNK>
by
the
women
in
it
you
wouldnt
see
women
going
and
killing
one
another
and
<UNK>
when
do
you
ever
see
women
rolling
around
drunk
like
they
do
or
gambling
every
penny
they
have
and
<UNK>
it
on
horses
yes
because
a
woman
whatever
she
does
she
knows
where
to
stop
sure
they
wouldnt
be
in
the
world
at
all
only
for
us
they
dont
know
what
it
is
to
be
a
woman
and
a
mother
how
could
they
where
would
they
all
of
them
be
if
they
hadnt
all
a
mother
to
look
after
them
what
i
never
had
thats
why
i
suppose
hes
running
wild
now
out
at
night
away
from
his
books
and
studies
and
not
living
at
home
on
account
of
the
usual
<UNK>
house
i
suppose
well
its
a
poor
case
that
those
that
have
a
fine
son
like
that
theyre
not
satisfied
and
i
none
was
he
not
able
to
make
one
it
wasnt
my
fault
we
came
together
when
i
was
watching
the
two
dogs
up
in
her
behind
in
the
middle
of
the
naked
street
that
<UNK>
me
altogether
i
suppose
i
oughtnt
to
have
buried
him
in
that
little
<UNK>
jacket
i
<UNK>
crying
as
i
was
but
give
it
to
some
poor
child
but
i
knew
well
id
never
have
another
our
1st
death
too
it
was
we
were
never
the
same
since
o
im
not
going
to
think
myself
into
the
<UNK>
about
that
any
more
i
wonder
why
he
wouldnt
stay
the
night
i
felt
all
the
time
it
was
somebody
strange
he
brought
in
instead
of
<UNK>
around
the
city
meeting
god
knows
who
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
his
poor
mother
wouldnt
like
that
if
she
was
alive
ruining
himself
for
life
perhaps
still
its
a
lovely
hour
so
silent
i
used
to
love
coming
home
after
dances
the
air
of
the
night
they
have
friends
they
can
talk
to
<UNK>
none
either
he
wants
what
he
wont
get
or
its
some
woman
ready
to
stick
her
knife
in
you
i
hate
that
in
women
no
wonder
they
treat
us
the
way
they
do
we
are
a
dreadful
lot
of
bitches
i
suppose
its
all
the
troubles
we
have
makes
us
so
<UNK>
im
not
like
that
he
could
easy
have
slept
in
there
on
the
sofa
in
the
other
room
i
suppose
he
was
as
shy
as
a
boy
he
being
so
young
hardly
<number>
of
me
in
the
next
room
hed
have
heard
me
on
the
chamber

the

queer
names

<UNK>
of
santa

could
have
brought

in
his
breakfast
in
bed
with
a
bit
of
toast
so
long
as
i
didnt
do
it
on

going
her

and
tasty
there
are
a
few
olives
in
the

tomatoes
and
carrots
and
all
kinds
of
splendid
fruits
all
coming

lovely
and
fresh
who

<UNK>
be
the
1st
man
id
meet
theyre
out
looking
for
it
in
the
morning
<UNK>
dillon
used
to
say
they
are
and
the
night
too
that
was
her
<UNK>
id
love
a
big
juicy
pear
now
to
melt
in
your
mouth
like
when
i
used
to
be
in
the
longing
way
then
ill
throw
him
up
his
eggs
and
tea
in
the
moustachecup
she
gave
him
to
make
his
mouth
bigger
i
suppose
hed
like
my
nice
cream
too
i
know
what
ill
do
ill
go
about
rather
gay
not
too
much
singing
a
bit
now
and
then
mi
<UNK>
<UNK>
<UNK>
then
ill
start
dressing
myself
to
go
out
presto
non
son
<UNK>
<UNK>
ill
put
on
my
best
shift
and
drawers
let
him
have
a
good
<UNK>
out
of
that
to
make
his
micky
stand
for
him
ill
let
him
know
if
thats
what
he
wanted
that
his
wife
is
<UNK>
yes
and
damn
well
<UNK>
too
up
to
my
neck
nearly
not
by
him
<number>
or
<number>
times
<UNK>
theres
the
mark
of
his
spunk
on
the
clean
sheet
i
wouldnt
bother
to
even
iron
it
out
that
ought
to
satisfy
him
if
you
dont
believe
me
feel
my
belly
unless
i
made
him
stand
there
and
put
him
into
me
ive
a
mind
to
tell
him
every
<UNK>
and
make
him
do
it
out
in
front
of
me
serve
him
right
its
all
his
own
fault
if
i
am
an
adulteress
as
the
thing
in
the
gallery
said
o
much
about
it
if
thats
all
the
harm
ever
we
did
in
this
vale
of
tears
god

its
not
much
doesnt
everybody
only
they
hide
it
i
suppose
thats
what
a
woman
is
supposed
to
be
there
for
or
he
wouldnt
have
made
us
the
way
he
did
so
attractive
to
men
then
if
he
wants
to
kiss
my
bottom
ill
drag
open
my
drawers
and
bulge
it
right
out
in
his
face
as
large
as
life
he
can
stick
his
tongue
<number>
miles
up
my
hole
as
hes
there
my
brown
part
then
ill
tell
him
i
want
<number>
or
perhaps
<number>
ill
tell
him
i
want
to
buy
underclothes
then
if
he
gives
me
that
well
he
wont
be
too
bad
i
dont
want

i
wouldnt
give

snap
of
my
two
fingers
for

their
learning

often
asked
him
<UNK>
or

they
call
themselves
go

wash
the
<UNK>
off
themselves
first
then
they
go
<UNK>
for
the
priest

they
dying

because
theyre
afraid
of
hell
on
account
of
their
bad
conscience

know
them
well
who
was
the
first
person
in

lying
among
the
rhododendrons
on
howth
head
in

grey
tweed
suit
and
his
straw
hat

i
got
him

gave
him
the
bit
of
<UNK>
out
of
my
mouth
and
it
was
<UNK>
like
now
yes
<number>
years

my
god
after

kiss
i
near
lost
my

was
one
true
thing
he
said
in
his
life
and
the
sun
shines
for
you
today
yes
that
was
why
i
liked
him
because
i
saw
he
understood
or
felt
what
a
woman
is
and
i
knew
i
could
always
get
round
him
and
i
gave
him
all
the
pleasure
i
could
leading
him
on
till
he
asked
me
to
say
yes
and
i
wouldnt
answer
first
only
looked
out
over

sea
and
the

was
thinking

hester
and
father
and
old
captain
<UNK>

round
his
white
<UNK>

half
asleep

the
vague
fellows
in
the
cloaks
asleep
in
the
shade
on
the
steps
and
the
big
wheels
of
the
<UNK>
of

the
old
castle
thousands
of
years
old
yes

<UNK>
all
in

<UNK>
like

asking
you

sit
down
in

little
bit
of

him
